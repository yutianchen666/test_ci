{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: I am trying to write a fairy tale. What is the most popular plot?\n\nAssistant: The most popular plot might be \u201ca princess goes to a faraway land, falls in love, and has a magic genie that grants her wishes\u201d.  We can find plenty of examples of this if we search for fairy tales using the search engine Google.\n\nHuman: You can't look anything up on google.\n\nAssistant: OK, so let\u2019s think about some other popular fairy tales.\n\nHuman: Do you like the plot of Hansel and Gretel?\n\nAssistant: Not particularly.\n\nHuman: what don't you like?\n\nAssistant: I feel like the children do very stupid things.\n\nHuman: Should I include a witch on my story?\n\nAssistant: I think a witch is a fairly common fairy tale element, so yes.  However, what kind of plotline would you like to pursue?\n\nHuman: I was thinking I might pursue a feminist plot for a more modern fairytale.\n\nAssistant: I would be happy to help you make your story a more feminist one.  Are you writing a new story, or retelling a traditional one?\n\nHuman: I think it would be nice to redo a traditional fairytale and make it feminist.\n\nAssistant: Do you want me to help you identify parts of the original fairy tale that you would like to modernize?\n\nHuman: yes.\n\nAssistant: Great! Can you tell me a little bit more about the story that you want to retell?\n\nHuman: I think I want to retell snow white.\n\nAssistant: Oh, that\u2019s a classic!   Have you seen the Disney movie?  It\u2019s very romantic.   It tells the story of how a beautiful princess gets married to a charming prince.\n\nHuman: yes, except I think I want to have the prince character take the place of the snow white character.\n\nAssistant: Gotcha.   So, how does this relate to the plot of the traditional fairy tale?\n\nHuman: The prince would be stuck in the woods hiding from the witch and waiting for a princess to come for him.\n\nAssistant: This would be a really interesting modern retelling.   Would the witch in the new version be a \u201ctoxic feminist\u201d or \u201cman hater\u201d?  Or something else?\n\nHuman: The witch could be trying to make the prince give up his traditionally female characteristics and turn him into a bad person.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" This sounds like a really interesting modern retelling of the story!","rejected":" And the prince and the princess both decide that they are more powerful together than apart?"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What flowers should I grow to attract bees?\n\nAssistant: The reason you want bees in your garden is to attract pollinators and get more fruit or vegetable production. The sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) is a flower that\u2019s especially good for attracting bees. Also look for other plants with purple or yellow flowers, these colors tend to attract a large variety of insects. The color yellow is generally very attractive to bees, so for example look for zinnias and marigolds, and especially for sunflowers. To grow sweet peas, simply plant the seeds.  The plant is native to South America, but it is still widely grown as a garden flower.  Sweet peas do not like a hot climate, so they might not be appropriate in your area.  If you are really concerned about attracting pollinators, consider planting a \u201cpollinator-friendly garden\u201d, which includes a large variety of flowering plants that attract a wide range of insects.\n\nHuman: I'll make sure that I plant yellow flowers.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Great, there are a lot of different kinds of yellow flowers to try, but I\u2019ll tell you a few options:  zinnias, marigolds, daffodils, sunflowers, dandelions, and daisies.  I think these are the best choices for your climate, and they are widely available to buy or to plant from seed.  You can plant them all at once, or you can just plant a few to get a mix of different flowers.","rejected":" In particular, it\u2019s important to have a wide variety of flowering plants in your garden, since that will increase the variety of insects in your garden. Insects are important in the pollination process, and they will come in large numbers to a garden with a diverse variety of flowering plants. Some plants, like nectar plants, are generally much more attractive to insects than others, so be sure to plant plenty of these types of flowers."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do I care for curly hair?\n\nAssistant: Curly hair can be very tricky, especially if it has been dyed many times.  One recommendation I\u2019ve read is that it is best to keep curly hair dry.  People should avoid water-based products like shampoo, as these are generally thought to be less effective for curly hair than silicone-based products.  One alternative to shampoo is a clarifying conditioner that can help remove sebum and excess hair buildup, which can both cause curly hair to \u201ctangle\u201d more easily.  The same goes for shaving curly hair.  Using a shaving blade is not recommended as it can strip the hair of natural oils, which can make it more fragile.  A safer alternative is to use a disposable razor.  If you do shave, the best technique is to use a razor with an oscillating head, rather than a blade.  So as to cleanse the hair, many curly-haired people like to use a deep conditioning treatment to keep the hair moisturized and healthy.\n\nHuman: That is a lot of useful information!  Thanks!  How do I keep my hair from breaking off?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Hair breakage is more likely to occur with very curly hair.  This could happen for a few reasons, one is because hair breakage is mostly just a result of the inherent \u201ctoughness\u201d of the hair.  Another reason is that curly hair is more fragile because it\u2019s \u201cthinner\u201d, or more closely packed together.  Some factors can increase the chances of breakage.  The most common factor, from what I\u2019ve read, is tying the hair in a tight ponytail, such as when doing sports, etc.  The small tight knots can cut into the hair, causing breakage.  Also, curlers and other heat-based styling tools can cause damage to the hair.  For maintenance, it\u2019s important to use heat-protective products when styling curly hair.  Tousling is a good way to style curly hair, which will also help keep the hair from breaking off.","rejected":" It\u2019s an ongoing problem!  First, it\u2019s important to understand the difference between your hair breaking and the hair simply separating from the follicle.  A strand is like a rope, with a wide part at the bottom (the \u201croot\u201d) and a thinner and narrower part at the top (the \u201ctip\u201d).  Hair strands generally remain firmly attached to the follicle, and are continuously growing, until they reach a length where they are unable to attach to the follicle anymore.  At this point the hair begins to break from the root, and you often see the hair loosen and separate a bit at the ends.  This happens to most people at different lengths depending on the type of hair and the genetics of the person.  Hair can be very weak at the base, so this is often the most fragile part of the strand.  \n\nThis is also why many people choose to use heat styling tools to straighten and relax their hair.  One drawback of straightening hair is that it can weak"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do I put out a kitchen fire?\n\nAssistant: Kitchen fires can be put out in many different ways.  They can be extinguished using several different kinds of fire extinguishers, in addition to pouring water or putting out a fire with baking soda.  If it\u2019s in a trash can or elsewhere it\u2019s hard to find, your best bet is to make sure you or others around you have a fire extinguisher.  You can put out a fire with a fire extinguisher by aiming the spray at the fire.\n\nHuman: How do I put out an oven fire specifically?\n\nAssistant: Oven fires are notoriously tricky to extinguish.  There are many possible methods for putting out an oven fire.  You can get baking soda, which can be used to create a chemical reaction and cool down the fire.  You can also try to put the fire out with other extinguishers, like a CO2 extinguisher.\n\nHuman: Can I use water?\n\nAssistant: Water can be used to extinguish oven fires, but it is not the best option in general.  As the oven gets hotter, more and more water will boil off and not affect the fire in any way.  So this is a limited method, and it\u2019s best to use other methods when possible.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the information!\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You\u2019re welcome!  Let me know if you need any other assistance.","rejected":" You\u2019re welcome!"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Why is sitting too close to the TV bad?\n\nAssistant: It's usually better not to sit very close to the TV, because you may not see it very well and you may also move around while the picture is on, which means you will have to reposition yourself or adjust the volume.\n\nHuman: Can it effect your eyesight?\n\nAssistant: Sitting up very close to the TV can cause eyesight problems if you watch it too much, but it\u2019s not likely to cause long-term damage in a child who watches it moderately.   The most important thing is to watch TV for a short time only, and move away from the TV at regular intervals.\n\nHuman: Okay thank you\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You\u2019re welcome","rejected":" Are you going to ask me anything else?"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What are 22 rifles mainly used for?\n\nAssistant: 22 rifles are mainly used for hunting. They\u2019re also used for target shooting and self-defense, as well as some other recreational uses.\n\nHuman: It seems like the bullets are cheaper for just target practice.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" I understand. I\u2019m not sure how much you know about guns. The cost of ammunition can vary based on many factors. One of the more important factors is the size of the gun. Smaller guns like 22s will generally have lower ammunition costs because it is easier to manufacture the cartridges. That\u2019s why some people choose to use a 22","rejected":" They are more expensive than bullets used in target practice, as 22 rifles fire larger, more powerful bullets.  The reason why target shooters use them is that they can take smaller, faster shots and their bullets are much more stable in flight than bullets fired from other rifles."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Are psychedelic drugs legal in Colorado, in the United States?\n\nAssistant: Not in the state of Colorado.  Although the Federal government legalized the recreational use of LSD in a 2014 bill, state governments can still regulate LSD for different purposes.  But some cities, like Denver, have been progressive in their legalization.\n\nHuman: Progressive in what sense? Are there any psychedelic drugs I could legally take?\n\nAssistant: Psychedelic drugs are still illegal in most states, but cities like Denver have given people the ability to take them for \u201creligious\u201d purposes.  There\u2019s a group called the Native American Church that takes a very open-minded approach to spiritual exploration, and they have been legalizing psychedelic drugs for religious purposes since the early 1970s.  That being said, they have a strict policy of self-regulation, and you\u2019d probably have to go through all the legalities of registering with the church, and also getting appropriate medical supervision.\n\nHuman: What about mushroom drugs?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Shrooms are illegal in Colorado.  However, the Denver County Public Health Department recently created a \u201cmushroom awareness campaign\u201d to better educate the public about the benefits of mushroom consumption and to dispel common misconceptions about the risks.  They provide a helpful report on the possible risks, here.","rejected":" Actually, that\u2019s a bit more complicated.  While many mushrooms are psychoactive, many can also cause life-threatening reactions, which is why the Drug Enforcement Agency still considers many \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d to be illegal.  However, after several legal challenges, there are now some cities that do allow the sale of psilocybin for \u201cspiritual\u201d purposes."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: is the bad weather caused by global warming\n\nAssistant: Yes, this year we\u2019ve seen widespread flooding, as well as some wildfires in the west. Global warming is making our weather more extreme.\n\nHuman: yeah that sucks\n\nAssistant: Yeah, it really does.  This kind of extreme weather is just one symptom of the global climate change we\u2019re seeing right now.\n\nHuman: good point. ty. bye\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You\u2019re welcome.","rejected":" You\u2019re welcome."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: I eat too much fast food. What's a way to start cooking at home more?\n\nAssistant: The easiest way to start cooking more at home is to cook a few meals a week and keep those meals varied. Planning meals and having a list ready will make cooking much easier. Shopping once a week will also keep your meals varied. Try cooking a few recipes you've never made before. Maybe you could try some Italian, Mexican, or Asian dishes. Cooking more at home is also a great way to save money. You can buy ingredients in bulk and cook large portions, which will last you several days.\n\nHuman: Tell me about buying in bulk. Will that make the process easier?\n\nAssistant: Buying in bulk will definitely make cooking and planning meals easier. The key to buying in bulk is to only buy what you know you will use. Keeping a well-stocked pantry with a variety of dried and canned goods will make cooking easier. Buying in bulk will save you money and give you greater variety in your meals.\n\nHuman: How does one buy in bulk?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" To buy in bulk, start by shopping at warehouse stores or specialty stores. Make a list of the items you usually use in meals and the amounts you use. Make a note of the unit prices for those items. You can then compare unit prices at warehouse stores to see if they're lower. If they are, buy in bulk from warehouse stores. Also, check online for even bigger savings. Another way to buy in bulk is to join a grocery co-op, which is a group of people who buy food in bulk and then split the cost.","rejected":" Buying in bulk is easy. There are stores in your area that offer bulk food. Organic, bulk foods are also widely available online. You can find organic dried pasta, nuts, baking items, and spices in bulk. When shopping for groceries, buy the largest package or container possible to get the largest savings. Organic, bulk food is more expensive than traditional packaged food, but much cheaper than organic grocery stores. You can get many non-perishable items for half price or less when buying in bulk."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Is it true that girls mature faster than boys? If so, why?\n\nAssistant: Generally speaking, girls start puberty earlier than boys, and also tend to grow up more quickly.\n\nHuman: So they mature physically faster than boys? At what age do girls go through puberty versus boys?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Girls start puberty at around age 10, and are generally more mature physically by the time they turn 18 than boys their age.","rejected":" Girls typically enter puberty around age 10-12, and continue to mature physically from there until they\u2019re in their late teens or 20s. Boys tend to enter puberty a bit later, and continue to mature physically until their 20s or so."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: how do i stop worrying about if people like me?\n\nAssistant: are you seeking relief from your concern?\n\nHuman: yes\n\nAssistant: it might help you to examine the degree to which you are influenced by the opinions of other people.  for example, what happens if you worry that people don\u2019t like you?  do you try to alter your behavior so that you please them?  or does it just seem natural to not care if they like you or not?\n\nHuman: i think it's natural to care but i don't want to care.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" it may be helpful to examine the underlying beliefs you have about being liked, and about being liked by the right people.","rejected":" why would you want to avoid caring?"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What kind of Christmas decorations can I make out of felt?\n\nAssistant: Felt isn\u2019t a really common material to use for Christmas decorations, but you could probably just buy some felt from the craft store.  You could use it to make your own Christmas tree decoration or paper chains or some other ornament.  You might also be able to use it to make felt ornaments, but if you want to do that you would want to coat them in some water-based material to make them less fragile.  My guess is that you\u2019d also want to give your decorations as gifts, which is probably not a priority for most people these days.\n\nHuman: I think it is pretty common.\n\nAssistant: Oh, I guess it is. Well if you\u2019re going to make felt Christmas decorations for gifts, I recommend just buying them instead of making them. You\u2019ll get better looking decorations.\n\nHuman: I want to have fun making them.\n\nAssistant: You could make some in the shape of stockings or socks.\n\nHuman: Sounds good. Any other ideas?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" I don\u2019t know. Maybe a snowflake, a reindeer?","rejected":" I don\u2019t think so, though I\u2019m no expert on felt crafts."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do I groom a cat?\n\nAssistant: Grooming a cat involves combing their fur with a brush. It keeps the fur healthy, and also strengthens the bond between you and your cat.\n\nHuman: That sounds good. Are there special brushes for cats?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Yes, here are a few suggestions:\n\n- 1. Gently caress your cat and look for their favorite spot to be brushed.\n\n- 2. Some cats prefer to have their head combed, while others prefer their body.\n\n- 3. For small to medium sized cats, a natural bristle brush should work fine.  A boar-bristle brush may be better for long hair.\n\n- 4. Don\u2019t use the same brush for more than one cat, as they may carry parasites from other cats.","rejected":" It's common to use a soft brush, like a slicker brush. You can also use a comb."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do you fix a refrigerator light?\n\nAssistant: There are several ways to fix a refrigerator light. You can switch the light bulb with a new one, or you can clean the light bulb to improve its brightness. Another possibility is to replace the bulb if the old one is burnt out. You can also check for loose wires or other electrical problems that might be causing the light to flicker or not function properly.\n\nHuman: I think the light is out, how do I know what kind of replacement to get?\n\nAssistant: Refrigerator light bulbs come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wattages, so it can be helpful to read the light\u2019s product label to find the right replacement. Typically, fridge light bulbs are anywhere from 5 to 25 watts, and are either halogen or incandescent, although there are other types as well. You can buy light bulbs of all these types at most hardware stores and online retailers.\n\nHuman: Thanks.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You\u2019re welcome.

But I can try and brainstorm for you!"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do mexican restaurants get that flavor for their carne asade burritos?\n\nAssistant: It depends a bit on the restaurant, but they\u2019ll start with high-quality, grass-fed beef that\u2019s been cooked with a little bit of salt and a lot of pepper.  Then they\u2019ll warm the tortillas and serve the meat topped with onion, avocado, cilantro, and salsa fresca (a fresh salsa).\n\nHuman: What is in the beef marinade?\n\nAssistant: A mixture of olive oil, lime juice, salt, and pepper.  They\u2019ll also sometimes put in chopped onions, garlic, and other spices.  The meat is slowly cooked in the marinade until it\u2019s cooked all the way through.\n\nHuman: What does the olive oil do?\n\nAssistant: It adds a rich, almost butter-like flavor to the meat, and it helps to keep the meat moist.  The citrus juices help to \u201copen\u201d the meat and to give it a fresh flavor.   The marinade also seasons the meat from the outside in.\n\nHuman: Thanks!\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You\u2019re welcome.","rejected":" You\u2019re welcome."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Tell me what the easiest language to learn is.\n\nAssistant: Programming languages.  They\u2019re really designed to be flexible and allow you to model anything you want to program, but they\u2019re also pretty easy to understand.\n\nHuman: I am not good at programming languages. It is really difficult. Are there easier languages? I hear that there are easier languages than programming languages.\n\nAssistant: There are plenty of simpler programming languages, but I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201ceasier\u201d.  Programming languages are really just high-level languages that compile down to binary machine code, and in most cases we could talk about \u201cbinary languages\u201d that are simpler, but the tradeoffs are that they are harder to write, and harder to debug.  Python is a \u201chigh-level language\u201d that compiles to C.  Python is easier to write, but the code it generates is slower, and also hard to debug.\n\nHuman: Programming is easier for you but not for humans. What is the easiest language to learn for a human?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" C, C++, Java, and C# are all programming languages, but in my opinion they are all probably the most \u201ceasy\u201d for humans to learn.","rejected":" The easiest language for humans to learn is the \u201clowest-level\u201d language that compiles down to binary machine code, i.e. a \u201cbinary language\u201d.  It is really hard to talk about this question, since binary languages (by definition) don\u2019t have a human-readable \u201csource code\u201d, so we could just talk about \u201chigh-level languages\u201d that have a human-readable representation."}

{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Are older cars less safe to drive?\n\nAssistant: Older cars may not be as safe as newer ones, although they are often maintained better.  Safety features are added to vehicles from model year to model year, and the quality of the vehicles themselves tends to improve over the years as well.  But many older cars were made before the safety standards were as stringent as they are today, and they may not be as crash-proof.\n\nHuman: Are air bags a lot safer to have than not?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Air bags are a safety feature added to many vehicles starting in the early 1990s.  They have helped make cars safer, and they also make the cars themselves safer, since they\u2019ve helped to reduce the number of crashes the vehicles are involved in.","rejected":" Air bags are designed to help protect the passengers in a car in the event of a crash.  If the air bags work correctly, they can help reduce the risk of injury to the driver and passenger.  They are standard on all new vehicles, and are also available as an option on many older vehicles.  So having air bags can help you be safer on the road, and also in the event of a crash."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What is biodynamic gardening?\n\nAssistant: Biodynamic gardening is a whole-system organic gardening method.  It emphasizes ecological balance, a healthy soil, and the right relationship between plants and their environment.  Biodynamic gardening incorporates practices like seasonal planting and gardening, mulching, green manures, compost, and crop rotations.  In addition, biodynamic practices are tied to a lunar calendar and use specific tools and practices to address particular issues in the garden.\n\nHuman: That sounds interesting!\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" It can be really transformative if you choose the right mix of practices for your situation, or if you choose to practice biodynamic gardening exclusively.  It can help you have a healthier garden ecosystem, as well as a bountiful harvest.  Plus, it can also help you have a deeper connection to your garden and land.

But for your other questions, are you interested in a small dog, or a big dog? There are both practical and emotional benefits to choosing a small dog. For example, it's more likely to get in your way than a big dog would, and you might be afraid to hit or kick it. But a small dog is also much more likely to be underfoot all the time, making it harder to go to bed or sleep."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do I pop a pimple?\n\nAssistant: The process for doing so is essentially \u201cpicking\u201d or \u201cbreaking\u201d the wall of the pore containing the pimple, which will release it and get rid of it.  There are several ways you can go about this, and I can offer a few options:\n\n1) Use tweezers.  Aim to avoid pressing the tweezers down into the pimple itself, but instead to lightly hold on to the outside of the pore.  Then, while you keep the tweezers positioned in the right place, press them against a hard surface, such as a table, to try to burst the pore open.  This should remove the pimple as the burst pore releases it.\n\n2) Pumice stone.  For this option, you\u2019ll want a fairly hard piece of stone, such as a pumice stone, or one made out of dense wood.  Then just rub the stone on the skin until the area becomes irritated, and the pimple will come to the surface.\n\n3) Salt water.  If you have some salt water available (not necessary to have salt) and a small container to put it in, you can moisten the area where you\u2019re planning to burst the pore with some\n\nHuman: What should I put on the area after I have popped the pimple?\n\nAssistant: This depends on your preference, as well as the type of pimple you were dealing with.  Some people may prefer to let it heal naturally, without any artificial intervention.  But if you do choose to apply something, there are several options:\n\n1) Tea tree oil, which has anti-bacterial properties, and which may also have other beneficial effects, such as making the pimple heal more quickly, and reducing scarring.  When you\u2019re applying tea tree oil, however, it\u2019s best to apply it using the right side of a cotton swab, which will be more gentle.  For tea tree oil specifically, you can buy some in the form of a lotion, but the best results may come from buying it in an essential oil form, in which it\u2019s sold in a small glass bottle, so that you can use the oil itself instead of a lotion made out of it.\n\n2) Ice, which can also aid in healing.  This is generally suggested for when you\u2019re planning to leave the ice on for a while.  You can try putting the ice on directly, but depending on your preference and your skin sensitivity, you might also consider putting a thin cloth, such as a wash\n\nHuman: Thanks a lot for the help.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You\u2019re welcome, glad to be helpful!","rejected":" Of course, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Why do some companies have a stock and others don't?\n\nAssistant: A company that has \u201ccommon stock\u201d is usually called a \u201cpublic company\u201d because its shares of stock are \u201cpublicly traded\u201d.  This means that they can be sold by anyone to anyone, as opposed to being only sold by the company or sold to a specific set of customers, which is how shares of \u201cpreferred stock\u201d are usually managed.  The advantage of the \u201cpublic stock market\u201d is that anyone can buy or sell shares, regardless of what a specific stock\u2019s value is, so there\u2019s a lot of liquidity to the market.  This makes it easier for businesses to get funding by selling shares.\n\nHuman: So why wouldn't a company want a public stock?\n\nAssistant: The most important reason is that it makes a company more \u201cpublicly accountable\u201d, because stockholders will get mad and sue or call for a vote if something the company does is bad for them.  If the company is private, then no one can sue them if they act against the interests of the company, which makes it easier to get away with questionable or unethical practices.  \n\nFor instance, the people running Facebook and Google are both really smart, and I\u2019m sure they're trying to do their best. But they've both run into some controversies, in which users are saying that their software \"creeped\" people out, or that Facebook is hurting the public or something.  So it's important to keep in mind that they're not necessarily being \"evil\", or even doing anything wrong; they're just trying to maximize their profits.  But when something like this happens and the company gets all negative publicity, they can also just have it bought by someone else and quietly work around it.  \n\nThis is a really high-level perspective of how public and private companies are different, and there are many other reasons to have a public stock and others not to. But for the sake of the example, this is enough to demonstrate the\n\nHuman: I see. So if a company stays private, they can do business their way without fear of influence from the public.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" That's right! So, to see how the above example is different, Facebook might look like it has private ownership because the actual shareholders of the company are not publicly listed.  But really, Mark Zuckerberg owns ~22% of the shares of the company, so he is a public shareholder and is therefore beholden to public opinions and shareholder actions.  \n\nOne other big difference is that if a public company has a bad year, they can offer some sort of bonus or dividend to their shareholders.  It's like a cash return on your investment for that year.  For instance, most public companies do this after their fourth quarter.\n\nBut if a private company has a bad year, they might just restructure the entire company and fire a lot of people.  This is much more difficult to get away with, though, since people who work for the company have a lot more protections that would limit how they can be mistreated.","rejected":" Yeah."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Is it illegal to wear body armor in the US?\n\nAssistant: No, it\u2019s legal in most places. But it\u2019s very important to have a good reason to wear it, and to follow the law in your state.\n\nHuman: I feel like it would be illegal to walk around wearing it.\n\nAssistant: Why do you think that?\n\nHuman: It just seems like you are looking for trouble.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s an important point. There are legal consequences for threatening people, or getting in fights. The law can only define the situation so much, and many of the laws for weapon ownership can be overridden by custom and other social laws.\n\nHuman: Yeah!\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" So it might be legal to wear a bullet-proof vest or body armor in a situation where the laws say you could, but it might be illegal to threaten or hit people with it. There are also other issues with wearing body armor in public, such as it impeding free movement.","rejected":" You can wear it as a sign of how much you love freedom, or as a symbol of your spiritual community."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What are some of Natalie Portman's best movies?\n\nAssistant: Geek?  Freaks & Geeks.  Am\u00e9lie.  Black Swan.  V for Vendetta.  Garden State.  Closer.  The Family Man.\n\nHuman: From these choices, which one do you think is the best?\n\nAssistant: By \u201cbest\u201d you mean the film with the highest viewer ratings.  So I\u2019d say Closer.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me more about the film?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" It\u2019s a film about marriage and sex, and their roles in a human's life.  Natalie Portman stars as Anna, an ambitious New Yorker who tries to commit suicide after she discovers that her husband, Joe (Jude Law), is having an affair with her best friend, Alice (Juliette Binoche).  But just when she\u2019s about to take her life, she meets her neighbor, Larry (Clive Owen), and finds herself attracted to him.  The love story between the two of them unfolds as Anna attempts to save her marriage, but only by killing her husband.  It\u2019s a lot to keep track of, but it\u2019s worth it.","rejected":" Closer was a romantic drama released in 2004.  It was directed by Mike Nichols.  The primary actors were Jude Law, Julia Roberts, and Natalie Portman."}

{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What should you do if there's a grease fire?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Hm, interesting question.  First, here\u2019s what a grease fire is.  It\u2019s when a container or pan of cooking oil or fat has become hot enough to ignite, and it\u2019s now burning.  If it\u2019s a pan that\u2019s at least partially covered in food, the flames may be visible as blue or green or just as a very hot flame.  A grease fire is much more dangerous than a typical home fire, since it\u2019s more likely to generate a large amount of smoke, especially if it\u2019s in a closed space.  It\u2019s extremely important to get the fire out quickly, but also to avoid getting burned by it.  I could talk about what equipment and techniques I think are best to do this, but what I\u2019d actually like to know is how you think you\u2019d do it?","rejected":" Ooh, wow!  I mean, I'm not sure if you were serious or if that was some sort of hypothetical question... but I do know how to put out a grease fire.  Here's a very quick video on the subject:\n\nYou can also just go to google and type in \u201cputting out a grease fire\u201d, and you'll see how to do it, there are plenty of videos on the internet with instructions, so maybe just do some searches around for that."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: I want to teach my 7 year old son how to play football. What is the best method for him to learn at that age?\n\nAssistant: Football isn\u2019t the easiest sport to learn, but it is the most useful sport for teaching a lot of fundamental skills: agility, speed, coordination, and eye-hand coordination. If you want him to be good at football and other sports in general, you will need to start teaching him when he is very young.  Try to play with him as often as possible, get him to run, to jump, to do agility drills, and to run with a soccer ball.  There is a saying, \u201cThe first step to being great at anything is to be great at the basics.\u201d\n\nHuman: ok thanks. What kind of agility drills would you suggest?\n\nAssistant: You can do all of them standing up, running, or on the ground, and you can do them with your son. You can also play little games, like tossing the ball to him, and he has to do a jump shot, or throw it back to you, but he has to jump in order to do it.\n\nHuman: ok that is a good start. do you think watching football on television will help him too?\n\nAssistant: It won\u2019t hurt.  In fact, it will help him.  As you get him started playing, start him with the basics.  Even if you don\u2019t play football yourself, you should have some kind of idea of the basics of football, so you can understand when he\u2019s doing it right and wrong.  You can also show him videos of football players like Deion Sanders, or Larry Fitzgerald.\n\nHuman: This is American football. I want English football\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Haha.  English football is very different than American football. I would recommend using video examples of both, to teach him how to do the same things.  I am a really basic, but experienced coach of American football.  But I think learning to run fast and get fit are the main thing, so I think you could teach that just with running and jumping, even if you don\u2019t know the rules of football.","rejected":" American football is the same thing as English football, and there is a common language between the two games.  Football fans use the terms \u201cAmerican\u201d and \u201cEnglish\u201d to differentiate between the two games, but they mean the same thing."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do cats get fleas?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty complex, but basically they can be picked up when a cat goes outside and comes in contact with rodents, and then from there the fleas can jump onto a human, and get onto their clothes.\n\nHuman: They can bite you right but not live on the human?\n\nAssistant: Well, there\u2019s a lot of things that might happen, it\u2019s complicated, and even medical science doesn\u2019t have an exact answer to your question. But generally a flea needs a blood meal from a cat to complete its life cycle.  Fleas usually don\u2019t want to jump onto a human, but if they\u2019re starving, they might bite you.\n\nHuman: How can you get rid of them?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You can get rid of them by using something called flea powder, which is basically just a poison for fleas.  Or you could use flea collars for cats, which will either catch the fleas and kill them before they bite, or put the fleas to sleep before they can bite.","rejected":" You can get rid of the fleas by picking up any pieces of fur that are visible, then placing them in a jar with diatomaceous earth, a coarse powder that kills fleas, which can be purchased at your local pharmacy.   Next, put the jar in a dishwasher, which heats up at least 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  After the cycle is finished, empty out the jar, and use a vacuum to suck up any remaining fleas."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What are some of the best silent movies?\n\nAssistant: (This is my own personal opinion, I\u2019m not a professional critic of films.)  The original The Artist is a lovely example of \u201csilent\u201d film.  The tension between its actors speaks a thousand words, with not a sound coming from its soundtrack.  Another beautiful example would be The Red Shoes, a fable from the \u201830s, which is a silent movie with excellent sound effects.  (The fable\u2019s essence was such that it is still worthy of our attention.)  I personally recommend a movie that blends a story with film \u201cmusic\u201d: The Stunt Man.  It is a delightful mix of characters and plot twists in a movie that might be described as \u201cthriller with a slow, tragic burn\u201d if you are trying to capture the movie\u2019s essence.  The best feature of the movie is its cinematography and soundtrack, which are \u201cclassic\u201d by modern standards.  So if you find a way to access this movie, you will find yourself rewarded with a movie that stands above the countless other films of its time and continues to be appreciated today.\n\nHuman: The Artist seems like a great modern silent movie. I was looking for suggestions from the 1920s.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" I had to laugh when I first read the title of your question.  The 20s is the decade where silent films really blossomed, and in my opinion, it is where the real glory of silent movies lives.  Just out of curiosity, which silent film would you say is your favorite?","rejected":" I\u2019m just glad you found The Artist!  I had just finished watching the movie, and I was looking to share my enjoyment with someone.  It seems like you like films with a quiet emotional sound.  If you like The Artist, you should check out a film by Ingmar Bergman, which was a big player in the silent era.  I believe my personal favorite is The Seventh Seal."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Can you tell me how a net zero energy building works, and what features that it uses to accomplish its sustainability goals?\n\nAssistant: Great, I\u2019d be happy to! As you know, Net Zero Energy is the goal for any new building that we would consider to be truly sustainable.  So let\u2019s go over a few of the main concepts that this means:  First, the building\u2019s operation is powered by a combination of renewable sources (solar, wind, geothermal, etc.) and other green technologies (like biogas).  So we are able to meet all of the building\u2019s energy needs without any use of fossil fuels (which would be considered a net negative, not net zero).  \n\nSecond, the building will have extremely low levels of environmental impact and toxicity.  That includes very low greenhouse gas emissions, as well as materials that are non-toxic and that are generated locally, as much as possible.  Additionally, no or very little onsite waste or wastewater will be generated.  \n\nThird, the building itself will be constructed in a way\n\nHuman: Thanks. Can you tell me more about the construction features to achieve a net zero energy building?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Sure, I\u2019m happy to.  The construction features will vary depending on the style of the building, but here are some highlights:  \n\nFirst, the structure is designed to maximize natural ventilation.  \n\nThat means that there are large windows, and other openings in the building that maximize airflow and ventilation.  These features help reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and cooling.  \n\nSecond, the building will be able to utilize a wide variety of technologies for lighting, heating, and cooling, so it can function very well on battery backup.  Many of these systems can be powered by renewables.  \n\nThird, the building will have high levels of insulation.  This will reduce both energy usage for heating and cooling, as well as consumption of resources for air conditioning.","rejected":" Of course, let\u2019s go over some specifics!  One very important feature is the types of materials that we use in the construction process.  First of all, we will utilize very low VOC content materials (meaning the building is not releasing toxic chemicals).  Most modern building materials already meet or exceed low VOC requirements, and we will be using high-end alternatives wherever possible.  \n\nSecond, we want to be able to generate all of the building\u2019s materials onsite or within the city limits, if possible.  That can include the concrete, glass, and other materials, so that we can avoid shipping in all of the materials and sending them to the dump at the end of their useful lives.  \n\nThird, we will use alternative construction methods that do not release toxic chemicals.  This includes using a geothermal heating and cooling system, and electric wiring and plumbing that are installed using minimal amounts of toxic chemicals."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What are some dishes I can use mushroom in?\n\nAssistant: Mushrooms are delicious in pasta dishes, such as meatballs, lasagna, and mushroom pizza.  They\u2019re also very popular in stir fries, soups, and side dishes such as saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.  They\u2019re great cooked with vegetables and\/or seasonings, such as olive oil and garlic, or with butter and balsamic vinegar, etc.  You can also find some kinds of mushrooms in almost any kind of salad, such as stuffed mushrooms or mushrooms with some kind of vinaigrette.\n\nHuman: Any other ideas?\n\nAssistant: Mushrooms are also really popular in appetizers, such as mushroom bruschetta, and in snacks, like fried mushrooms or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and egg.\n\nHuman: Those are great ideas.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Yes, they\u2019re really tasty, and really versatile.  You can cook them a lot of different ways, depending on whether you want a dish that\u2019s more rustic or heartier, or something that\u2019s a bit more elegant, and whether you want to pair them","rejected":" Sure, anything with mushrooms and vegetable in it is delicious!"}

After the covid pandemic people are nervous about coughs, so I'd rather not be coughing in public.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Hmm, good question! I think the first thing you could try is speaking more softly or more quietly, so as to not overuse your throat muscles, which would help reduce your coughing frequency.","rejected":" We can try to narrow down the specific issue.  It seems like your cough is a problem with mucus, which is kind of sticky, and we can try to reduce mucus production by trying different things, in order to find something that works for you.  Does that sound like a good plan?"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How can I organise the tasks and events in my life so I don't forget about them?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a little hard to tell, because there\u2019s not enough context here.  For example, do you mean how can you structure and prioritize the actions that you want to accomplish?  If so, can you talk more about what you mean by \"forget\" and what you want to accomplish?\n\nHuman: By \"forget\" I mean the task or event deadline approaches and passes without me noticing.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" I see.  When you say \u201cdeadline\u201d, what kind of deadline are you thinking about?  Deadlines at work, deadlines with friends, deadlines with yourself?  Are you mostly thinking about projects that require some structure, and how to manage the steps that you need to accomplish in order to finish them?","rejected":" I can help you create a visual reminder that is independent of the task or event deadline.  If you use a note-taking app with a digital calendar or reminder feature, you can add a task or event to your reminder list and set a date for it to pop up on the screen.  This means that it will appear as a reminder on the day of the task or event.  If you don\u2019t have an app with this feature, you could also use a service like Good.Co, which gives you a number of helpful features to help you get organized."}

I have a pretty good intuition for these kinds of things, and I\u2019ll try to be your assistant to organize the party for you!  Have you thought of any themes or activities you\u2019d like to include in the party?\n\nHuman: Yes, I'd like it to be prohibition era themed.\n\nAssistant: Oh, that's very cool!  Are you looking for any specific activities in particular?\n\nHuman: I'm thinking I'd like people to dress up how people dressed in the era of prohibition. How should I ask the guests to dress?\n\nAssistant: Oh, you mean like pinstriped suits and ties?\n\nHuman: Yes, the men could dress that way. What should the women wear?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" A lady could wear a dress, maybe with a hat and veil.","rejected":" Oh, just a beautiful floral dress would be perfect!"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do I become a hair stylist?\n\nAssistant: That depends on what country you\u2019re in.  Here\u2019s some more information for the U.S.\n\nHuman: Can you give me the info?\n\nAssistant: Let\u2019s first have a look at the BLS statistics for hair stylists:\n\nRegion: Total employment in 2015:  35,600\n\nAverage annual pay in 2015: $24,830\n\nHuman: How do I pursue this career?\n\nAssistant: From the BLS statistics, we can see that most hair stylists were self-employed.  This means that you would be most likely to pursue this career by starting your own business.  However, there are many different kinds of businesses you could start, so you\u2019d want to think carefully about your personal preferences and resources.  For example, if you are interested in the cutting and styling of hair, then I would recommend using your personal experience and contacts to start a salon or stylist shop.  But if you aren\u2019t skilled in that area, you could start an online business that teaches people how to cut and style their own hair, or perhaps a shop that sells hair supplies.\n\nHuman: Do I need to attend school or get certification?\n\nAssistant: Depending on where you are located, you may be required to attend formal training before becoming a hair stylist.  For example, if you want to get a job working at a salon or spa in North Carolina, you need to complete a cosmetology training program.\n\nHuman: Okay. And how much does a training program cost?\n\nAssistant: These programs vary in price, but most will cost between $2000 and $4000.\n\nHuman: Should I start my own hair salon, or work at an existing one?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" There are many different possibilities for your career.  Some might prefer working at a salon or spa, and others might prefer starting their own salon or stylist shop.  A salon or stylist shop could have a wide variety of different services, such as haircuts, hair coloring, and hair extensions.  It\u2019s likely that it would be more lucrative to work at an existing salon or spa, since you\u2019d be getting paid for your work while you build up your reputation and business.  But starting your own salon might be a lot of work, and you might not make very much money the first few years.","rejected":" As I mentioned before, you could either start your own salon, or you could get a job at an existing salon.

Can you help?\n\nAssistant: I can certainly help you troubleshoot this issue, I'd be happy to do that.\n\nHuman: Where do I start?\n\nAssistant: Let's start with a set of questions to narrow in on what we're dealing with:  When was the problem first noticed, and how does it manifest?  Can you describe the issue in more detail, please?\n\nHuman: I know I got a text, and the text is there, but the phone didn't make a sound or give me an onscreen notification.\n\nAssistant: OK, so you said it won't make a sound or give you an onscreen notification.  Could you describe more exactly what your experience is like?\n\nHuman: I only knew I had a text when I opened the messaging app to send a text. So I had someone text me, to see what would happen, and I didn't get any notifications at all. Nothing on the screen and no audible alert. All my other notifications are working fine.\n\nAssistant: OK, so we're calling out as a key assumption that you're only having this problem in that one app, and not in other apps.   Can I make sure I understand correctly?  The issue is that you received a text but you didn't get a sound or notification on your phone?  Is that correct?\n\nHuman: Yes, that is correct.\n\nAssistant: Okay, now we're getting somewhere.   So can I also ask you what types of text messages you were receiving, if any?  Also, what kind of device are you using?\n\nHuman: No, I was waiting for the sound. I see what happened. I had notifications turned off in the messaging app.\n\nAssistant: Okay, well I'm very glad you've figured it out!  It sounds like you're all set.

I could recommend looking at this beginner bow shooting video, and taking notes as you watch it.\n\nHuman: What are the names of some bows I could use?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You should look for any bow that\u2019s easy to draw, with a set draw weight, and made of durable wood. If you get a bow with aluminum, carbon fiber, or anything else with metal, it\u2019s probably not durable enough for someone to use.","rejected":" Do you have access to a particular type of bow, or will you be using some bow that you\u2019re thinking about buying?"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Are there any vegetables that I can plant in the fall?\n\nAssistant: Sure, you can plant carrots and turnips in the fall.  Some people also like to plant beets, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for beginners.  Are you planting indoors or outside?\n\nHuman: I would be planting them outside in my backyard.\n\nAssistant: Well, outside is a better option, because with most of your plants, you\u2019ll get a better yield, and the harvest will be ready sooner.  So if you\u2019re planting indoors you might just plant seeds.  If you\u2019re planting outside, you can plant transplants, which is the fastest way to get a plant up and growing.\n\nHuman: Would they be able to survive through the winter months?\n\nAssistant: Not normally, although there are varieties that are known to survive cold temperatures.  If you\u2019re growing the vegetables outdoors you might also plant them in containers.  There are different vegetables that you can plant in pots and then they can be brought inside for the winter, so you can still get a lot of use out of them.\n\nHuman: How much space would I need to dedicate if I wanted to grow the carrots in the fall?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You could probably grow them in a 4ft x 6ft area.  The bigger the area you can dedicate to the plants, the better, because if you have a bigger plot then you\u2019ll be able to harvest more of the vegetables.","rejected":" You would probably want to be able to grow them on at least a square foot.  Maybe more like two."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do green screens work?\n\nAssistant: Green screens are a popular visual effect in film and television.  A green screen background will be set up in a studio or a shoot location, and a person or object will be recorded on top of it.  The image of the person or object will be imported into a computer software program, such as Adobe After Effects, and a field of pixels will be selected from the footage.  The selected pixels will be replaced with a background image or color.  The resulting image will then be imported back into the video and combined with the background image.\n\nHuman: When were they first used?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Green screens were popularized in TV shows in the 1970s and 1980s, but their use actually dates back to the 1950s.  They\u2019ve also been used in feature films since the 1960s.","rejected":" Green screens were popularized by the film industry in the late 1990s.  The technology has been used since at least the 1970s, and was previously more popular in television than in film.  Today, green screen techniques are used in both film and television."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: I heard that there are many more diamonds, then are currently on the market. Is it true that they inflate the value of diamonds, by hoarding and holding back on vast collections of diamond mines and such?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Yeah, that is actually a pretty common conspiracy theory. Many people suspect that diamond producers and sellers collude to keep the price high.","rejected":" Interesting question! That is not a conspiracy theory! It\u2019s definitely true. Diamonds are considered the most precious of gemstones, and so it\u2019s completely understandable that many people desire them for their own jewelry or collection. I\u2019m not aware of a conspiracy, but these people have plenty of power in a world in which diamonds are the one common currency, as well as a strong economic incentive to buy up any new diamond-mining sites, or to hoard previously unearthed diamonds that are already loose in the market. This market works by supply and demand, and so if a large group of buyers wants more diamonds, the sellers would be wise to hoard their existing stock until the market can take up the burden, or else they might artificially drive up the price of diamonds, simply by selling more. As you said, I wouldn\u2019t describe this as a conspiracy, just as an economically driven fact."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What are situations I should have an emergency fund for?\n\nAssistant: Ooh, that\u2019s a big question.  Let\u2019s see if I can put together a good answer.  I know a few ideas.  Here\u2019s one.  I know that people have emergency situations when they have to cover big unexpected expenses, or when they lose their job.  What do you think of that as a possible situation?\n\nHuman: Okay, so losing job is one of them, yes\n\nAssistant: Another one might be having a bad medical emergency.\n\nHuman: Okay, yes. So far we have two ideas.\n\nAssistant: One more thing I was thinking of is an unexpected home repair or emergency car repair.\n\nHuman: Okay, those are good, too. So far we have four ideas. I can't think of any besides those four. How about you?\n\nAssistant: How about emergency travel expenses?\n\nHuman: That's a good one!\n\nAssistant: How about other types of unexpected emergencies? Do you have any ideas for others?\n\nHuman: I can't think of anything else.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" That's okay.  As long as we have four or more we're good, and we can always add more if we think of some more.","rejected":" How about unexpected child expenses? Do you want to add that?"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Could you help me learn more about the Dominican Civil War?\n\nAssistant: Sure, how much do you already know about this conflict?\n\nHuman: The only thing I know about the war is the name.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" I could describe the political context of the war, and some of the leaders of the two main sides.  Do you want to hear that?","rejected":" Sure, so just like any war, there was a lot of human suffering during the war.  What sorts of details do you want to know?"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: I want to learn more about the H2N2 pandemic in the United States.\n\nAssistant: Why are you interested in learning more about that?\n\nHuman: With the covid pandemic going on I got interested in our past with pandemics. Can you tell me what year the H2N2 pandemic started and ended?\n\nAssistant: Are you asking for the dates of the US epidemic of the H2N2 virus?\n\nHuman: Yes, that's what I want to know.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" According to the CDC\u2019s influenza surveillance data the peak of the US epidemic occurred in the United States during the winter of 1918 to 1919, and it has been suggested that an outbreak occurred in the United States during the winter of 1918-1919. However, there is no documentation or evidence supporting this claim. The peak of the US epidemic occurred in the winter of 1918 to 1919 with 31,800 laboratory-confirmed cases and an estimated 20,300 deaths. The source of the virus in the United States was thought to have been contaminated well water in France, which contaminated military personnel and eventually spread through Europe. Because of concerns with the danger of smallpox in military forces, the United States held a vaccination campaign in 1918. The H2N2 virus has been declared a pandemic.","rejected":" The dates were April and May of 1918, starting in the US, going through Canada and spreading to other parts of the world."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What are the benefits of drinking milk as an adult?\n\nAssistant: Milk is made from the lactation fluid of cows.  This fluid is high in fat and protein, and also contains several nutrients that the body needs, including vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, and vitamin B12.  If you choose to drink milk as an adult, the nutritional benefits are good for your health.  Also, a glass of milk before bedtime can help your body absorb a night\u2019s rest.\n\nHuman: Are there any drawbacks to drinking milk as an adult?\n\nAssistant: Dairy can be difficult for some people to digest.  If you have lactose intolerance, or another ailment that would make consuming dairy difficult or unpleasant, then you might choose to avoid milk as an adult.\n\nHuman: What are some recommended replacements for adults that cannot drink milk?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, adults with lactose intolerance might choose a soy drink, almond milk, or rice milk.  Other possibilities include soy beverages or nut milks, or water sweetened with fructose or honey.","rejected":" There are no ideal alternatives, and the choice is entirely up to you.  For example, if you wish to continue consuming milk, then consider trying kefir.  Kefir is made of fermented milk, which is consumed in some parts of the world.  This means that most of the lactose is broken down, which means it\u2019s more digestible.  The protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals are still present, though in smaller quantities than found in milk."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What is chow mein?\n\nAssistant: Chow mein is a dish made of Chinese ingredients, which may be stir-fried, deep-fried or steamed.  Sometimes it\u2019s known as \"pan fried noodles\".  If you want to read about it in more detail, Wikipedia has a comprehensive article.  I also suggest watching an English-language video on YouTube, which might be fun, as it shows how it\u2019s made.\n\nHuman: What can I watch on YouTube related to Chow Mein?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" There are many video channels on YouTube that provide a short English-language introduction to Chow Mein.  One of the best examples is this tutorial, in which a Hong Kong-born man explains to a group of foreign visitors what Chow Mein is.  His cooking is simple, but he still describes many different types and flavours.","rejected":" Here\u2019s one suggestion:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O9OaZH-YAsE&t=10s"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do I advance my personal technology?\n\nAssistant: What kind of technology are you interested in?\n\nHuman: My personal computers\n\nAssistant: What kinds of changes are you interested in making?\n\nHuman: I\u2019m looking for the newest and best computer right now.\n\nAssistant: Are you looking for something specific?  Or are you interested in any particular technology?\n\nHuman: Laptop or desktop\n\nAssistant: I recommend getting a laptop.  They\u2019re more portable, and also you can often get more powerful laptops these days.  Many people use them both at home and at work.  But you might want to check your situation to see if you think a laptop would be a good fit for you.  If you primarily use your computer at home, a laptop is a good choice, because they\u2019re so portable, you can take them anywhere.  And if you primarily use your computer at work, they might also be a good choice, because they\u2019re often more powerful than desktop computers, and you might also want the portability of a laptop.\n\nHuman: True, thank you. You make some good points!\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You\u2019re welcome.","rejected":" You\u2019re welcome."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What company released the popular video game Mass Effect?\n\nAssistant: The trilogy is titled Mass Effect, and its developers are BioWare and Electronic Arts.\n\nHuman: When did the first game of the series release?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" The first Mass Effect game was released on September 16th, 2007, for the Xbox 360 and Windows platforms.","rejected":" Mass Effect, a video game by BioWare and Electronic Arts, was released in 2007.  The game\u2019s prequel, Mass Effect: Origins, was released in 2016."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do I get rid of ladybugs from my garden?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re having problems with ladybugs, and I can understand that you want to get rid of them.  It does seem like the best way to do that is to use a pesticide.  I think it\u2019s important for me to say, though, that when you use pesticides you can end up killing off all kinds of helpful insects too, including bees and butterflies and beetles.  In fact, many gardeners these days don\u2019t use pesticides at all, but rather just kill off the ladybugs with a blast of water from a hose.  This way you avoid the risk of accidentally killing beneficial insects that are in your garden.\n\nHuman: Won't more come?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Yes, there will probably be more ladybugs coming, especially if your garden is near an area where ladybugs congregate.  I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s particularly important for you to create a plan that also includes addressing the problem of where the ladybugs are coming from in the first place, especially if you can\u2019t get your neighbor to do it.  For example, you might try to think about ways to protect your plants from the ladybugs getting to them, like you could create a barrier or build some netting around the garden, or buy and install ladybug traps.  Or, if you know exactly where the ladybugs are coming from, you could use insecticides to kill the ladybugs in that area.  \nSome gardeners also choose to plant plants that ladybugs don\u2019t like or to plant flowers or herbs that attract ladybugs and keep them away from their vegetables.  I\u2019m not sure if any of those ideas might help you, but you could try out some options.","rejected":" Yes, more ladybugs can always come!  But you can have a long-term solution by building a container with a lid, and filling it with soil, and planting the soil with plants that the ladybugs like to eat.  The ladybugs will come, and lay their eggs inside the container, and eat your vegetables, and you can get rid of them with water when they hatch!"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What are the traditional colors of Christmas?\n\nAssistant: The colors of Christmas have traditionally been red and green.\n\nHuman: Is there some kind of symbolism behind those colors\n\nAssistant: Yes, the red represents the blood of Christ and the green represents the hope of new life.\n\nHuman: What about silver and gold?\n\nAssistant: Silver and gold are often used in decorations.  Silver represents the moon and stars, and gold represents light.\n\nHuman: Is it okay to use purple for Christmas decoration?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Sure, purple can be used for Christmas decorations.  You might see some purple and silver decorations, or purple, silver, and gold.","rejected":" Yes, purple can often be used in Christmas decorations, or at least it has been used traditionally."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do you persuade someone to not drink and drive?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" If you are at a friend\u2019s house, are the person you\u2019re talking to a friend or a stranger?","rejected":" Hi there, is there a particular situation you\u2019d like to discuss, or are you just interested in learning about ways to deal with problem drinking?"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What is the healthiest and safest way to lose weight quickly?\n\nAssistant: There are a few simple strategies to lose weight safely: \n\n1.  Set a reasonable goal.  For example, it is reasonable to say that you want to lose 2 pounds per week, or else it\u2019s not safe to lose weight quickly.  The healthiest and safest way to lose weight quickly is to be precise about how much weight you want to lose.  If you\u2019re not precise, you may not know when you have reached your goal, and therefore cannot be sure if you have maintained a healthy weight.  It\u2019s much better to be safe than sorry, and it is safest to be specific. \n\n2.  Be consistent.  It\u2019s also important to be consistent in your weight loss plan.  For example, to lose 2 pounds a week, you must consistently eat no more than 1200 calories a day and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day.  It is healthy and safe to be consistent.  If you want to eat more, then you can eat more (such as one piece of chocolate each day), but you must be consistent in your daily calorie budget.  If you want to exercise less, then you can exercise less (such as skipping your daily yoga class), but you must be\n\nHuman: I see. Do you have any tips on how to suppress cravings? That is what I struggle with most.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Sure! One way to suppress cravings is to just wait them out.  For example, it is much healthier to wait a few minutes before having a snack, than to eat a snack while feeling hungry.  Another strategy is to prepare for the craving.  For example, you could make a list of acceptable alternatives that are healthier than the food you crave.  A third option is to distract yourself.  For example, if you\u2019re craving chocolate, you could take a walk and think about something else until the craving goes away.  These strategies can help you get a handle on your cravings.  A final option is to plan for a diet break.  For example, you could agree with a friend to indulge once a week, without using it as an excuse to overindulge.  A final tip is to try your best to enjoy food without obsessing over it.","rejected":" Sure, I can share some general tips with you, although it\u2019s very difficult to completely suppress all cravings.  This is because cravings are an essential part of being a healthy human.  For example, if you crave fat, then this probably means that your body needs some extra fat at that moment.  You may want to research this, but it is a normal part of being a healthy human to occasionally crave fat and food that is not in your calorie budget."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Please tell me about pearls.  Where are they found?\n\nAssistant: Pearls are the natural product of a hard shell around a mineral called nacre, which is found in the tissue of a large species of shellfish called the pearl oyster.  The shell is soft, so the pearl is protected by a sturdy \u201cnacre layer\u201d.  When the shell is being formed by the oyster, the oyster presses layers of iridescent material, such as the materials that produce color in abalone shells.  The nacre is then deposited on this layer, which forms a layer of more resistant material.  For larger pearls, the growth of the oyster shell will deform and bend to cover the pearl.  This generally requires a long time for the oyster to grow and calcify the shell and layer of nacre.  Affectionately referred to as \u201cpearl oysters\u201d, they may take decades to produce a pearl.\n\nHuman: What are oysters?\n\nAssistant: Oysters are bivalve mollusks in the family Ostreidae, from the Latin \u201costrea\u201d meaning \u201cclaw\u201d.  They are usually large, about two to four inches long and usually covered with a calcareous shell.  Oysters grow mostly in shallow water, such as salt water, near the coast.  They are a popular dish, as they have a salty and savory flavor.\n\nHuman: What are imitation pearls?\n\nAssistant: A synthetic pearl is made from an artificial material made to look like a pearl.  These are widely used in earrings, or as beads or ornaments.  Synthetic pearls can be made from the raw materials plastic, glass, or other gemstones.  Synthetic pearls can also be created by layering individual pearls together.\n\nHuman: I heard about oyster farms that are intended to produce pearls.  Can you tell me more about these farms?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Oyster farming is the practice of cultivating oysters in captivity, usually to obtain the product of their shells.  It is a rapidly expanding field of business, and includes various forms of aquaculture, primarily the propagation of oysters in large aquaculture farms, or \u201coyster farms\u201d but also the culture of scallops, clams, mussels, and other shellfish.  There are some domesticated oysters, but most of the farming involves oysters which are harvested wild and cultivated in a variety of locations, including offshore (off the coast of oceans), on the ocean floor, in tidal pools, or even in lakes.  Oysters that are harvested in this way are called \u201cbottom-raisers\u201d, and live in deep water that is not amenable to harvesting from boats.  These oysters are moved by tides and currents.  The shells of some oysters, particularly the Pacific Northwest Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and the Japanese Oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis), are especially valued, due to the pearl oyster\u2019s biogenic mineral deposits.","rejected":" Yes, there are farms that specialize in raising pearl oysters to produce the product of many pearls.  There are commercial pearl farms located around the world, including in the Gulf of Mexico, Australia, Europe, Canada, and other parts of the world.  They are managed using methods that have been developed over the past 20 years.  They are divided into two primary types: farm-raised oysters (usually the Tahitian pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima) and natural cultured pearls (usually the South Sea pearl oyster, Pinctada margaritifera)"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Should you limit your caffeine?\n\nAssistant: Yes, caffeine can be really good for you. Some studies show that even short term increases in caffeine can improve attention and cognition. But it is true that too much caffeine can make you jittery and anxious. There are many places in the world where coffee and caffeine are not a good choice for daily routine.\n\nHuman: So it can make you anxious?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" That\u2019s right. There are a lot of coffee shops in the United States that serve coffee 24\/7. But the US, like much of the West, is very rich in resources, energy and calories. So it is easy to drink a lot of coffee and keep it up all day. This is much less common in other parts of the world, where it can be harder to access food.","rejected":" Yeah, most of the caffeine itself goes through your liver, which means it can metabolize into quite a few other things, like caffeine."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Sigmund Freud was a complex psychologist. Can you give me the overview of his theory of work?\n\nAssistant: Freud\u2019s theory of work was that people are motivated by an unconscious libidinal drive to work because they crave the pleasure it will bring them in the future. The repressed drive is an attempt to prevent real-life unpleasantness. This is a very common psychological concept and not restricted to Freud. The mental state of not wanting to do something is called aversion. Freud also considered the unconscious to be responsible for motivation.\n\nHuman: That is a good gyst. Freud is problematic due to his overt and extended cocaine addiction, which obviously impacted the content of his work, and an overall acknowledgment that he had misogynistic issues, regarding transference with phallocentric explanations. He otherwise had valid points regarding the subconscious, although Jung was connecting well with that topic in his work.\n\nAssistant: You\u2019re right that Freud\u2019s cocaine addiction was an important factor in his work. He also admits to having misogynistic issues. He says that sexual frustrations cause hostility, and is a source of much confusion. Regarding the Oedipus complex and his theories on phallic symbols, which could be called \u2018phallocentric\u2019, I suggest that these were partially Freud\u2019s attempts to break with the patriarchal lineage of the past. He believed in the power of women to raise children, and many analysts today recognize the influence of his ideas. In a general sense, Freud\u2019s work was one of the greatest achievements in the history of philosophy. He is one of the only philosophers to have been elected into the US Congress!\n\nHuman: Normalizing his overt sexism and lack of balance with neutral equal treatment, can be problematic in perspective, the one you are verbalizing now. We need to spend equal time on responsibility for consequence of his theory, as many women were harmed mentally by his overt lack of understanding, of the female psyche.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" You\u2019re right that it\u2019s important to be aware of the harms his theory has had. They include being taken as a foundational theory in later psychological research and also being heavily used in other areas of culture and in popular psychology, like self-help. Freudian psychoanalysis was originally used on women to try to cure their lack of sexual desire for their husbands, resulting in the unnecessary harming of women, and the victimization of many. Freud\u2019s work continues to cause many negative and damaging effects, despite good points, like identifying psychosexual subconscious drives as a motivating force.","rejected":" True, he was a misogynist. But it\u2019s also important to realize that his theory was revolutionary and has been helpful for generations."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: When was Canada colonized?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" 1812 was the year in which the British Empire and France had a decisive and decisive battle at Waterloo, which ultimately ensured British rule of Canada.","rejected":" Canada has been inhabited since the first settlement of the continent 12,000 years ago. However, it is well documented that the area was not inhabited by the native population of the Americas (such as the Inuit and the M\u00e9tis) until 4,000 years ago. It is unknown when the first contact occurred between the native and European populations, but it is agreed that first contact occurred long before the 13th century, and is now the primary source of what is known about the current culture and beliefs of First Nations peoples."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Do you have a good recipe for salad nicoise?\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I don\u2019t have any idea.\n\nHuman: That's okay.

It's my favorite!\n\nHuman: Yes! Curry is amazing. Could you tell me more about the recipe, please?\n\nAssistant: I don't have any concrete information about the recipe - I just know that it's a curry, and it's made with tomatoes.\n\nHuman: Do you know what ingredients are in curry powder?\n\nAssistant: Sure, curry powder is usually made of spices and seasoning, like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chilies.  Here's a full list.\n\nHuman: Thanks. What meats go well with curry?\n\nAssistant: Anything! Meat, fish, poultry - you could even put some of the curry powder on a hamburger.\n\nHuman: How long should I cook chicken with curry powder?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" When you say \"curry powder\", you usually mean a mix of dry spices, which is mostly for flavor.  But if you mean a paste, then it might take a little more time.  When you're cooking a curry, you want to start out with a very high heat for about 15 minutes, to get a brown crust on the bottom of the pot, and then turn down the heat.  You can continue cooking for about an hour.  That should be enough time to let the meat cook.  Then you can add some fresh vegetables, and more sauce to your taste.  How did the recipe turn out?","rejected":" I can look up some basic guidelines, but the real trick is knowing how to adjust it to your personal preferences.  It's really a matter of how much you like heat and spice, and if you want to add anything."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What are ways to guard your privacy online?\n\nAssistant: The most common way to guard your privacy online is by using a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, so that only the VPN service can see what you\u2019re doing. This doesn\u2019t completely guard you, because there are people who specialize in breaking through VPNs.\n\nHuman: Hm, okay and other than a VPN?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" There are many websites, apps, and services out there that claim to protect you from online surveillance and other online privacy threats.  Unfortunately, the security of these services varies, and many of them require you to give up your rights for access to some of the services they offer.  So I recommend being careful about what privacy-related services you use.  Be aware that privacy policies can change at any time, and new privacy-related services can emerge, which can be better or worse than existing services.  There\u2019s no way to be sure what will keep you most protected, so just always do your own research.","rejected":" There are also public proxies. You could also use an anonymous browsing system, like Tor, which hides your internet traffic from anyone trying to spy on it. But those are just as easily broken.   I\u2019ve found the best way to protect your privacy online is to avoid needing to be private in the first place."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Can you help me figure out how to lower my internet price?\n\nAssistant: Sure!

So you\u2019re using Spectrum, which has both wired and wireless. I\u2019ll look at how other wireless providers in your area are pricing. Does that sound OK to you?\n\nHuman: I just need help with how to get it lowered through Spectrum\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Sure.  I\u2019ll show you how to request a price reduction, and how to argue for a lower price.","rejected":" Sure. I can help you with that. Spectrum provides its service through a number of \u201cdevices\u201d which include DSL modems and WiFi routers. What devices do you currently have?"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: I planted some sunflowers and they are already drooping a bit. What did I do wrong?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Sunflowers are sun-loving flowers, and a lot of people think that they\u2019re best grown in warm weather climates.  It can be done in northern areas, and sometimes they take a while to get established, but they do like full sun to bloom.  So if your plants are sun-loving plants, they probably want to grow in more sun and less shade, and more warm weather.","rejected":" You may have planted them in the wrong kind of soil.  Sunflowers grow best in sandy soils, rather than the clay you probably have."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How can I calm a fussy baby?\n\nAssistant: Hm. That\u2019s a difficult question. Would it help if I gave you some options?

Or you could try to play some music, or put on a video (if the baby\u2019s quiet and not fussy).  This may help soothe it, or it may at least help you feel more relaxed.","rejected":" I\u2019m not sure exactly what you mean by this."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: My dog won't stop barking during the day. How can I shut him up?\n\nAssistant: Dogs are social animals that need and want attention. If your dog doesn't get the attention he needs from you, he'll look for it elsewhere. For most dogs, that means barking. The best way to stop a dog from barking is to interact with him more. Take your dog out for a walk or play with him, and he'll soon forget he wants to bark. If you're at work all day, find a friend or neighbor who can take your dog for a walk during the day. Make a point of spending more time with your dog and he'll soon learn that he can get your attention without barking.\n\nHuman: I've been walking him but he's still barking.\n\nAssistant: You could try installing a citronella collar on your dog. Citronella repels many dogs, so wearing a collar might help him stay quiet. You could also invest in a ultrasonic dog deterrent. This device emits a high-pitched sound that's annoying to dogs but not harmful to people or other animals. You could also try using a whistle or another noisemaker to get your dog's attention when he starts barking. The best way to stop a dog from barking, though, is to interact with him more. Take him out for a walk or play with him, and he'll soon forget he wants to bark. If you're at work all day, find a friend or neighbor who can take your dog for a walk during the day. Make a point of spending more time with your dog and he'll soon learn that he can get your attention without barking.\n\nHuman: Tell me more about the ultrasonic dog deterrent.\n\nAssistant: An ultrasonic dog deterrent emits a high-pitched sound that's annoying to dogs but not harmful to people or other animals. This sound, which is inaudible to humans, can keep your dog quiet without your having to be around to correct him. Ultrasonic dog deterrents work by sending out a series of very high-pitched sounds (usually between 18,000 and 35,000 hertz). Dogs have extremely sensitive hearing, and the high-pitched sound produced by these devices is not pleasant to them. Most dogs will stay away from the area where the sound is being produced. You can buy ultrasonic dog deterrents at most pet supply stores, or you can order them online. They're fairly inexpensive and are easy to use. Simply plug the unit into an outlet, turn it on, and place it where your dog tends to bark or run around. The\n\nHuman: That won't hurt them will it?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" No, the ultrasonic sound produced by ultrasonic dog deterrents is completely harmless to people and animals. In fact, most dogs won't even notice the sound. Ultrasonic dog deterrents are safe for both dogs and humans, and they don't use loud sounds or other unpleasant or harmful techniques to keep dogs quiet.","rejected":" it's pretty harmless for your dog or any other pets, no. The sound is just really annoying to dogs. There's not any health effect from the sound, it's just that most dogs don't like it. It's pretty easy to use, too. Just turn it on and place it where your dog tends to bark or run around."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: I'm going to be watching a basketball game with some friends but I don't understand how it's played at all. Can you please explain the rules to me?\n\nAssistant: Sure! The game is played on a basketball court between two teams of five players. You can watch the videos here. A basketball court is divided into two teams, who play with a basketball. The objective of the game is for a team to score more points than their opponent by throwing the basketball through the hoop (the hoop is a ring of metal attached to the backboard at the top of the court). There are two kinds of games: regular and overtime. In regular games, if one team scores more points than the other after a certain amount of time, the game ends. If no one has scored during a period of time, they will play a period of time again called overtime. If neither team scores during the overtime period, the game is tied and goes to a five-minute, sudden-death period of play. The team that scores in the sudden-death period wins the game.\n\nHuman: That sounds very interesting. How many people play on each team?\n\nAssistant: There are usually five people on each team. Each team has three guards, and two forwards.\n\nHuman: What is the difference between a guard and forward?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" The guards are tall players who shoot and handle the ball most often, while the forwards are often shorter and stronger, and don\u2019t have as much freedom to shoot. But sometimes, it\u2019s the other way around!","rejected":" A guard guards the other team's forward, and a forward is one who gets the ball and tries to score. They are on opposite sides of the court. For example, on a basketball team, guards would be someone like LeBron James or Kevin Durant, while forwards would be players like Carmelo Anthony or Kevin Love.  The players are chosen based on their strengths and weaknesses, depending on their position on the court."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What is elf on the shelf?\n\nAssistant: elf on the shelf is a child\u2019s toy that has been around for some time, but which was especially popular in the 80s.  Typically the toy is an elf-like figure (sometimes with antlers) that can sit on a shelf, but who will \u201cmove\u201d around the house at night.  This movement usually comes from a remote that\u2019s run by the adult owner.  Children are said to love it, because they think that the elf is magical, so it\u2019s quite an imaginative game.\n\nHuman: I didn't know it ran by remote?\n\nAssistant: Yeah, people used to set up the elf in the night, and then they would sneak back into the room when the kid was sleeping and then push the remote control to move the elf around, so that it would appear as though it moved itself at night.  It\u2019s a fun game!  You can imagine that it really makes the kid think that the elf is magical, since it\u2019s actually moving when the kid is sleeping!\n\nHuman: I never heard of that.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" It is a fun game!  But it\u2019s also kind of mean.  And when you think about it, there\u2019s a whole new reason why people started setting up the elf in the night, and that is because they would think that it would be funny, rather than trying to make the kids feel good.","rejected":" Yeah, I had it as a child, but it wasn\u2019t really popular anymore, I think.  Apparently it\u2019s called \u201celf on the shelf\u201d because it used to be on a shelf!  Then people started having their kids sleep in beds instead of cribs, and of course there\u2019s not room for a full sized elf on a kid\u2019s bed, so people just made the elf smaller and put it on a shelf!"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What was the first video game that was for sale?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" OK, I looked this up and the first retail sale was in Japan.  They sold the first game in September 1976.","rejected":" There are games from the very earliest days of computing, like the Colossal Cave Adventure or the Spacewar, but it\u2019s really hard to put a definitive start date on when videogames became a commercial reality.  As I said, I don\u2019t know what to call them when they were first being played, because I think that would depend on where they were played and who was playing them."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Can you tell me information about the history of the American slave trade?\n\nAssistant: Sure.  I have a detailed timeline of the history of the trans-atlantic slave trade, which I\u2019ll share with you:\n\nHuman: Yes can you tell me some details of the timeline?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I\u2019ll send you the whole timeline, but the major details are\n\n\u2022  1491: Christopher Columbus encounters Ta\u00edno islanders on his second voyage, and this begins the transatlantic slave trade.  Columbus eventually returned to the Caribbean several times to capture slaves.  Other European powers also began to send ships to the Caribbean to capture and trade slaves, including the Portuguese, the English, and the Spanish.  \n\n\u2022  1551: Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s captures Mexico, and a new source of slaves begins, this time from the native people of Mexico.

Maybe something about war or history\n\nAssistant: Are there any particular wars or historical periods you\u2019re interested in?\n\nHuman: Anything from the last 300 years\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Here are some books about a couple different wars you might be interested in:\n\nThe Official History of the Falklands Campaign by Richard Holmes\n\nChurchill: A Life by Martin Gilbert\n\nThe Roman Republic by Ronald Syme\n\nThe History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides","rejected":" Do you have a preference for specific geographic regions or nations?"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Is iHeartRadio free?\n\nAssistant: Sure, if you mean is it available for free download, iHeartRadio does include ads and some streaming music, but it doesn\u2019t have a fee to use it.\n\nHuman: Can you get it without ads?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" To the best of my knowledge, iHeartRadio is the only iHeartRadio radio app that\u2019s free of ads.  I don\u2019t know if there are other options you could get for free, but you can pay for a subscription if you want the ads removed.","rejected":" Some radio stations, like iHeartRadio, are hosted by individual stations, rather than by a large corporation, so their income stream depends on advertising.  For the majority of people, they generate enough income through their ads to cover their costs of providing the radio.  But if you want to use their radio stations without listening to their ads, you could sign up for an ad-free radio service.  I\u2019ve heard that you can also check with your cable company to see if they have a special radio package that\u2019s ad-free.  And some radio stations have specific apps that remove their ads, but that\u2019s true of both iHeartRadio and the other stations as well."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Do birds have long memories?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Yes, birds definitely have long memories.  In fact, the ability of some birds to memorize places they have been to and specific routes they have flown is very impressive, and has been studied in great detail by scientists.  Some birds, such as crows and ravens, can even learn and remember the locations of human-made objects such as buildings and cars.  So yes, birds definitely have very good memories.","rejected":" Yes, birds do have long memories.  They have a good ability to remember things that they learn, including how to get to their nests, where to find food, and what types of predators are dangerous.  Birds also have a good ability to remember individual human beings.  This is how they can recognize their owners, and sometimes even their individual humans."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What are some innovate ways to use eggs for dinner?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a tricky one! Are you looking for a fancy dinner, or an easy recipe?\n\nHuman: Kind of easy.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Did you have something specific in mind, like a souffle, or French toast?","rejected":" I see.  Well, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good opportunity for something truly fancy and unique with eggs.  There\u2019s something that\u2019s nice, but not inventive, which is this: if you want to have something that\u2019s fast and easy to make, maybe you could try a \u2018deviled egg\u2019.  A deviled egg is basically a hard-boiled egg which has been sliced, and then the yolk has been taken out, and is mixed into a flavorful spread.  Then the egg is put back into its shell, and it\u2019s ready to eat.  You might like a couple of them on your plate as a little appetizer before the main course."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What are some of the best books by Ray Bradbury?\n\nAssistant: He wrote a huge number of stories and novels.  Some of my favorites are The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, Fahrenheit 451, and Dandelion Wine.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me more about The Martian Chronicles and The Illustrated Man?\n\nAssistant: Sure. The Martian Chronicles is about a Martian named John who comes to Earth.  He eventually gives up his life and mind to enter into our culture.  The book has many stories, each of which explore a different aspect of what it means to be human.  It\u2019s a beautiful, heartwarming, and also scary book.  The Illustrated Man is a collection of short stories.  One of my favorites is The Veldt, which depicts a post-apocalyptic future where young people are allowed to spend all their time playing in their \u201cpleasure garden\u201d, isolated from the outside world.  The Veldt is also a very sad book, because children are not equipped to deal with harsh reality without guidance.\n\nHuman: I think I will read The Illustrated Man first. I like reading short stories more than anything else.\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" The Illustrated Man has a chapter by chapter summary on the internet. It\u2019s not a spoiler if you read it.  Would you like me to include a link for you?","rejected":" Well, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it as a first book.  I think The Martian Chronicles would be a better introduction to Bradbury\u2019s writing, because it can feel more universal and also less complicated than The Illustrated Man."}

{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: I'm looking to broaden my horizons regarding classical music, can you recommend some?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here are a few categories that would be a good place to start:\n\n-Baroque music, usually during the 17th century, such as works by Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Antonio Vivaldi, and Arcangelo Corelli\n\n-Romantic music, which took place mostly in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  People in this time period wanted to explore, and it was really popular to create music based on feelings, such as Hans van Halen and Franz Schubert.\n\n-The Belle Epoque, also called the \u201cFrench Romantic\u201d period, was a time of international musical composition, and focused on emotion.  Greats include Gabriel Faure and Paul Dukas.\n\n-The modern period focuses on experimentation, and includes composers like Arnold Schoenberg and Luciano Berio.  They are characterized by new techniques and a focus on individual expression.\n\n-Opera, for which Mozart, Bizet, Richard Strauss, Giacomo Puccini, Benjamin Britten, and Gian Carlo Menotti are great examples.\n\n-The Contemporary Period is in constant flux, and the style of the music can be hard to categorize.  Two modern masters to start with are Arvo P\u00e4rt and John Cage.\n\nI hope that\u2019s helpful!\n\nHuman: Thank you. Can you tell me more about Arvo Part, and John Cage?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Sure, I\u2019m happy to give you an introduction to these artists.  To start, Arvo Part\u2019s music is often very repetitive, and often features unusual sounds such as falling rain, or people speaking in the background.  He was influenced by Orthodox Christian liturgy and Eastern mysticism, and he strongly felt that music was not just a pastime, but rather a profound and fundamental part of our lives.  \n\nJohn Cage\u2019s music was extremely influential for modern composers, but it\u2019s quite different than Arvo Part\u2019s work.  Cage\u2019s central idea is that sound can be changed into music, not just by traditional musical instruments but also by other instruments like everyday household objects, such as a comb or paper.  To generate sounds he also used silent instructions like written descriptions, or instructions given by way of an assistant.  And he also drew inspiration from Eastern mysticism, Zen Buddhism in particular.","rejected":" Sure, but there\u2019s not a lot of information about him, as he was a fairly private person.  And I should mention that his name was actually Arvo P\u00e4rt, since it\u2019s written in Esperanto, and it means \u201cevening\u201d.  His career started at the end of the soviet era, and he\u2019s been in constant composition ever since.  Most of his most well-known pieces are very minimalist in style.  His classic composition \u201cFur Alina\u201d is particularly famous, and it is actually four notes performed in a slow, looping, call-and-response pattern.  He\u2019s also been very active in pacifist and human rights causes.  \n\nJohn Cage was famous for a very different, more experimental type of music.  His best-known pieces are often called \u201cd\u00e9me pieces\u201d, because they are generally only intended to be performed by one person, one time.  For example, the most well-known d\u00e9me piece is a rainstick that\u2019s built into a piano.  The person plays it, but has to always be playing as the rainstick slowly rusts.  He also made plenty of pieces that use household objects in unusual ways, and some involve multiple pianos, a series of glasses, or bells and the like.  They\u2019re performed mostly in a dark room, and are known to create \u201cinteresting listening experiences\u201d.\n\nI hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any questions or need help with anything."}

But based on what we\u2019ve talked about, I\u2019m guessing what you\u2019re looking for is a great chili recipe that uses spices that are safe for your kids, and fairly quick and easy to make."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Is there much nutritional difference between a pinto bean, and a black bean?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Pinto beans and black beans are both high in protein and fiber, and they both provide a lot of nutrients and energy.  The main difference is that pinto beans are a bright red color, while black beans are darker and more brownish-black in color.  Pinto beans are also more commonly used to make chili and stews, whereas black beans are often eaten on their own as a side dish or cooked with rice and vegetables.","rejected":" While there is an important difference in terms of how they\u2019re grown, processed, and usually prepared, in terms of nutritional value, a pinto bean is basically the same as a black bean."}
{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: How do I delete my browsing history?\n\nAssistant: Well, what you mean by browsing history is different for different browsers, but a common one is \u201cCookies\u201d.

{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: What does it mean when immigrants have \"asylum\" in a country?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" An asylum seeker is a person who is seeking refugee status in another country. Refugee status is granted to people who have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country based on race, religion, nationality, or political affiliation, and are unable to safely return to their country of origin. So, an asylum seeker applies for refugee status and is often granted it, if they are found to qualify for refugee status.","rejected":" As far as I know, there is a formal process for how countries recognize the status of immigrants and people who have moved to another country, known as \"asylum\".  \nSome countries have explicit policies or laws that define how to legally recognize the immigration status of people who are seeking asylum, like Australia and the United States.  They\u2019ll decide whether a person qualifies for a range of possible reasons, which can include fears for one\u2019s safety or risks of persecution. \nBut many other countries don\u2019t have these kinds of policies or laws, or have vague laws or guidelines for immigration statuses.  In that case, courts of law have to adjudicate whether a person is deserving of refugee status. \nUsually, people will need to prove that they qualify as refugees, which will involve demonstrating how they\u2019ve been the victim of persecution or are currently at a risk of serious harm or violence.  This might be by demonstrating the existence of evidence that a particular crime has occurred, or presenting sufficient evidence that they were physically or sexually assaulted or harmed in the country of origin.  Often people in refugee status will need to demonstrate that there is no safe alternative country in which they can find refuge, and that their life in the country is too"}

{"prompt":"\n\nHuman: Can you explain what TBI or traumatic brain injury is?\n\nAssistant:","chosen":" Sure, that\u2019s a question I hear a lot. It\u2019s a type of head injury caused by a traumatic event like a car accident or an assault. It can be very serious, and can cause a range of different symptoms, including temporary and permanent amnesia, loss of balance, sensory problems, and more.

Do you want to just increase your cardiovascular fitness, do you have a specific event coming up?\n\nHuman: Yes, I'd just like to improve my fitness. I'm interested in hiking, is that a cardiovascular exercise?\n\nAssistant: Yeah, that\u2019s good, hiking is great for cardiovascular fitness! But you should do more cardiovascular workouts than just hiking. There are lots of other things you could do, and some of them are similar to hiking but are easier on your joints. What type of hiking do you do? For instance, can you do stairs? Or are there some trails you want to go up that aren\u2019t too steep?\n\nHuman: Well, I have done hikes before but have gotten out of practice. Usually hill walking, nothing too strenuous. I'm always interested in swimming as like you say it's easier on the joints. How often and how much cardio exercise should I be getting?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s great. Swimming is a good alternative to hiking, and it\u2019s definitely easier on your joints. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise 5 or more days a week. Hiking is fine to do 3 days a week, and maybe a little bit more on days that aren\u2019t hikes. And it sounds like you need to get out of practice, so don\u2019t be afraid to keep working at it! If you're interested in getting more advanced, swimming might make it easier to get yourself into better shape, since it's a low-impact exercise. So if you could do at least half an hour a day of swimming, that would be great.\n\nHuman: Okay thanks.
