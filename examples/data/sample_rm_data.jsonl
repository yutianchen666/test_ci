    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you describe the steps to clean fingerprints and smudges from a laptop screen\n\nAssistant: Yes, certainly. To clean your screen, you first need to use a microfiber cloth or soft, damp cloth to gently wipe down the surface of the screen.

Third, once you\u2019ve done this, continue to watch your expenses and income in the spreadsheet, and only make purchases that you can afford.\n\nHuman: Thanks. But what are the most important ways in which someone can improve their credit score?\n\nAssistant: Here are the most important factors, from most to least important:\n\n   (1)  Payment history - pay on time every time,\n   (2)  Credit utilization ratio - your total debts divided by your credit limit (suggests how much credit you\u2019re using),\n   (3)  Credit age - the length of time for which you\u2019ve been responsible with your debt,\n   (4)  Public records - anything that could appear on your public record like a bankruptcy or lien,\n   (5)  Open accounts - any open credit cards,\n   (6)  Recently opened accounts - the number and amount of recent credit accounts you\u2019ve opened (and how much debt you have on those accounts),\n   (7)  Homeownership - the amount of equity you have in your home,\n   (8)  Length of credit history - the length of time you\u2019ve had credit (suggests how responsible you are with credit),\n   (9)\n\nHuman: And what are the most important of these in order to improve my score the most?\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I have heard that the moon is getting farther away from the Earth, why is this?\n\nAssistant: Oh, that\u2019s easy!  The Earth orbits the sun in an elliptical path.  Because of this, the moon\u2019s orbit is slightly eccentric, which means it\u2019s a little closer to us when it\u2019s on the \u201cnear\u201d side of the earth, and a little farther away when it\u2019s on the \u201cfar\u201d side.\n\nHuman: I mean that the orbit of the moon is getting farther out from the Earth.\n\nAssistant: Oh, that\u2019s also easy!  The moon moves faster when it\u2019s closer to the Earth, and slower when it\u2019s farther away.  The moon\u2019s acceleration and deceleration as it moves out from the Earth depends on the position of the Earth relative to the sun.  So the distance between the Earth and the moon depends on the amount of time the moon spends farther away and closer to the Earth.\n\nHuman: Was the Moon ever closer to the Earth than it is now?\n\nAssistant: When the moon was first formed from the debris left over from the birth of the Earth, it was a little closer to us.  But its orbit expanded over time because of tidal friction with the Earth.  This is similar to the way a river or lake expands as it flows from a high place to a low one.\n\nHuman: I bet it was bigger in the sky and the ocean tides were stronger.\n\nAssistant:",
    "chosen": " That\u2019s right!  So now, when the moon is closest to us, the tides are at their peak.  So this is also a time of the year when you can see the tides rising high, because the difference between the high tides and low tides is the greatest.",

This right to use is made available by the \u201ctimeshare owner\u201d, typically a real estate developer or a hotel or resort.\n\nHuman: Are timeshares a scam?\n\nAssistant: Timeshares are not a scam per se.  There are certainly a lot of bad timeshares out there that are overpriced, but they are not inherently a scam.  Timeshares are also not for everyone, so be sure you fully understand what you\u2019re getting into before you sign up for a timeshare.  Some people love them, but others find them too complex and too restrictive.  So in that sense they are a bit of a gamble.  It all depends on your individual circumstances.\n\nHuman: If I went to a timeshare, what's the process like?\n\nAssistant:",

Instead of throwing rice, you could just use flower petals or confetti instead.  Or you could just express your congratulations without any decorative throwable items at all.",
    "rejected": " Oh, that\u2019s actually a good question! Most people don\u2019t realize how much rice farmers\u2019 water and soil quality is compromised by processing so much rice. Of course, the same is true for all forms of agriculture.

Can you offer suggestions on how I can be a good friend to them?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m glad to hear it is survivable! I\u2019m also glad to hear that it was caught early, as this gives them an excellent chance at successful treatment.  There are several different parts to a good friend. One is the specific person you\u2019re trying to help, the other is everyone else who cares about them. I have a couple of thoughts:\n\n-Be honest, but don\u2019t overwhelm them with more details than they want.  \n\n-Be there when they\u2019re ready to discuss, and try to listen without trying to solve problems for them.  I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ll have things you\u2019ll want to say, too, which is fine, but try not to force your ideas on them unless you know that that\u2019s what they want.  \n\n-Be attentive, and be aware of when they don\u2019t want to talk or think about it.  \n\n-Ideally they\u2019ll have a medical professional (like a nurse or doctor) to help them, but if they don\u2019t, just make sure they know there are people in the world who care about them and that they\u2019re not alone.  \n\n-Finally, if they want to talk, they probably need a\n\nHuman: Solid suggestions, more concise is better. I think being neutral and available are wise.\n\nAssistant: Thank you!  I can try to be more concise if you like, here are a few more pointers. \n\n-Reassure them that their condition is not their fault, and that most people survive it.  \n\n-Ask them about the type of cancer they have.  Does it have a good prognosis?  \n\n-If you want to help, you can be available for physical tasks, like cooking or running errands.

If you want to learn a language from scratch, I think Spanish is generally a little harder, because of the pronunciation, and also some of the vocabulary can be a little tricky. English grammar is pretty straightforward, but there are a lot of words, and also English can vary quite a bit from region to region."

People can also spread viruses and bacteria by coughing or sneezing. These germs cause diseases, so to protect your health and the health of other people, it\u2019s important to reduce the risk of germs spreading. You can avoid germs by washing your hands with soap and water regularly, especially before eating or preparing food. It\u2019s also good to avoid sharing things like cutlery, cups, and dishes. A good way to keep things clean is to clean them regularly, with a disinfectant or detergent that kills germs. You can also make sure that surfaces like tables and counters are clean, especially after using them.",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: What place in the USA has all of the seasons?\n\nAssistant: There are no places with all seasons in the USA. However, the climate zones are very broad, and so the weather is often not exactly the same all year round.  For example, right now the National Weather Service has defined seven different climate zones in the United States. The zones range from Tropical Savanna, with average temperatures between 15 and 31 degrees Celsius, to Periglacial, with average temperatures below -36 degrees Celsius.  Tropical Savanna covers the southeastern United States and has four distinct seasons, including hot and humid summers and mild winters. The other zones range in temperature from above freezing to colder than -40 degrees Celsius.\n\nHuman: Are there all the seasons in Tennessee?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint a location that\u2019s in the perfect climatic zone for all four seasons, since no place in the USA has all seasons in their entirety.  Tennessee has three different climate zones, so you can expect different weather at different times of the year.  Winter in Tennessee is in the Polar and Alpine zones, with average temperatures between 5 and -20 degrees Celsius.  Winter is cold but rarely gets as cold as -40 degrees Celsius. Summers in Tennessee are in the Tropical Savanna climate zone, with average temperatures of 15 to 31 degrees Celsius. Tropical Savanna covers the southeastern USA, so you would expect different climates and weather in other parts of the USA.\n\nHuman: Would you say Savannah or Tennessee have all the seasons?\n\nAssistant: No, because the climate zones are much broader and more variable than the seasons.  So even the extremes of temperature don\u2019t encompass the totality of the year.  For example, right now the National Weather Service has defined seven different climate zones in the United States. The zones range from Tropical Savanna, with average temperatures between 15 and 31 degrees Celsius, to Periglacial, with average temperatures below -36 degrees Celsius.  Tropical Savanna covers the southeastern USA and has four distinct seasons, including hot and humid summers and mild winters. The other zones range in temperature from above freezing to colder than -40 degrees Celsius.\n\nHuman: Is Nashville a good place to move if I want all the seasons?\n\nAssistant:",
    "chosen": " Nashville has four distinct seasons. However, it\u2019s likely that you want to move to a place where all of the seasons are distinct, rather than in a place where the seasons just gradually change. So if you\u2019re looking for a place that\u2019s very much like a tropical island, you should consider moving to a location that has warm, sunny weather all year.",
    "rejected": " Nashville is in the Middle Tennessee region of the state, which is in the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8b.  You can find the different zones in the USDA publication \u201cPlant Hardiness Zones in the U.S.,\u201d which you can find at http:\/\/www.usna.usda.gov\/Hardzone\/ushzmap.html.  The USDA defines zones based on their climate, which means that they are very different from the seasons.   For example, it is possible to grow apples in zones 5 and 6 (below 28 degrees Celsius), or grapes in zones 5 and 6 (above 28 degrees Celsius), even though the seasons are not the same in the different zones."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why are there differences types of glasses for different types of wine?\n\nAssistant:",
    "chosen": " There are two main reasons, actually.  One is that some wine glasses are designed to concentrate the flavor of the wine, which is what you want to do when drinking a relatively strong wine like a cabernet sauvignon.  The other reason is to avoid oxidation, which can spoil the flavor of wine.  I think in many cases wine glasses are glass because they\u2019re designed to diffuse light, which may avoid the oxidation, and also to filter out UV rays.",

I recommend \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d.  It\u2019s a classic that you may have heard of.  The plot is a madcap chase to save a newspaper story, and the main characters are a newspaper editor and his wife who don\u2019t get along anymore.  But the show that goes on around them is very funny, I think you\u2019ll enjoy it.\n\nHuman: That could be good. Can you give me a few more?\n\nAssistant: Sure. How about \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d, also a romantic comedy.  It\u2019s about two people who are friends, but don\u2019t get along very well. Then they go on a road trip together, and things change.  I recommend it because it has a lot of humor, and many people like it, including me.\n\nHuman: Do you have any others?\n\nAssistant: Yes, I do. You might also like \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d.

It\u2019ll grow like crazy.\n\nHuman: That makes no sense. I just want to know what flowers would be nice to grow\n\nAssistant: Well, you could use your imagination to visualize what would be pretty. Maybe you could use a combination of tropical flowers and roses, and it would be like a Hawaiian paradise? Or something else that appeals to you.\n\nHuman: That sounds good. What are some tropical plants and flowers I could grow?\n\nAssistant: Do you have any idea what a tropical climate is like? It can be raining for days straight, and plants in such an environment are specialized for coping with those conditions. They have broad, flat leaves that wick moisture from the ground, and there\u2019s also plenty of species that use a modified flower structure to quickly self-pollinate, to ensure the plant\u2019s chances of survival, since there are often long gaps between rainfall. So tropical plants don\u2019t necessarily suit dry, Mediterranean climates.\n\nHuman: Okay. Do you know any tropical plants or flowers that would be pretty?\n\nAssistant: You could consider some of the species commonly cultivated in people\u2019s gardens here in France. Take the oleander, which is a tree that has masses of beautiful pink flowers, and it can have either berries or leaves, depending on the species. The species sold as a \u201chouse plant\u201d is better for indoor use, since it has non-poisonous berries. But if you\u2019re interested in plants that do better outdoors, then look for oleanders with white or cream-colored flowers and leaves, like the oleander pictured below:\n\nHuman: Any others?\n\nAssistant: You could grow azaleas, or hibiscus, or bougainvillea, which have lots of colorful petals and flowers that smell nice.\n\nHuman: Thanks.\n\nAssistant:",

How do I do that?\n\nAssistant: Cut off the bottom portion of the leg so it\u2019s no longer jeans, but more like a skirt.  Then you\u2019ll need to sew on some kind of edge to keep it from getting too big.\n\nHuman: Okay, what else can I do with jeans that have holes in them?\n\nAssistant: You can wear them as is.

    "chosen": " Sure!  That\u2019s a classic from central Mexico, it\u2019s actually something you can buy in a shop (usually pre-made).  You fry thin tortillas in hot oil, with thinly-sliced beef.  There are some other variants - \u201cflautas de res\u201d (pork), or \u201cflautas de verduras\u201d (veggies), or \u201cflautas dulces\u201d (sweet).  The important thing is, the dish is really a sort of rolled-up fried thing.  You can serve the dish warm, and top with some shredded lettuce or cheese.  So, to make the dish, it\u2019s best to start by slicing the tortillas thinly.  There are actually different ways of doing that - I\u2019ve seen it done with a knife or with a mandolin, but the easiest thing is probably to just go to a convenience store (la tienda), and buy the sliced ones in a package.  After that, just fry them in a skillet with a little oil and some salt, or on the stove over a low flame, until they start to become crispy and brown.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I cook food with a wok?\n\nAssistant: A wok is a large frying pan, and it can be used to make pretty much any sort of stir-fry you can imagine.  I assume you\u2019re curious about how to use a wok in general, so I\u2019ll just explain how that works:\n\nFirst you want to heat your wok up.  To do that, you put some oil in the wok and wait until it\u2019s warm.  If you have a heat-proof glass top to the wok you can just use a flame or some other heating source directly, but it\u2019s usually recommended to use a heat-proof mat on the burner instead of putting the wok directly on it, to avoid cracking the wok from the intense heat.\n\nOnce your wok is nice and hot, add the ingredients you want to cook to it, and cook them over the heat.  Typically this involves cooking them on one side until they get a nice golden color, then flipping them and cooking on the other side, to get a nice brown color and to allow the ingredients to cook thoroughly.  You don\u2019t have to cook it all the way through -- instead, you want to stop cooking before the food is \u201covercooked\u201d, which is when it\n\nHuman: Okay I'll get it hot and add the oil. After that I should just keep stirring all of the food around, right?\n\nAssistant:",
    "chosen": " Yep!  Just keep stirring and moving things around the wok to get an even temperature and cook all of the ingredients evenly.  If you\u2019re having trouble with oil spitting out, use a little less.  Keep cooking until everything has a nice brown color.",
    "rejected": " Exactly! And I hope that helps.  I\u2019d love to hear more about what you\u2019re cooking, if you feel like telling me, but that\u2019s totally optional."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do you take care of a betta fish?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019ll have to look up the specifics, but according to the American Betta Fish Association: \u201cThey like water that is slightly on the cooler side, somewhere around 70 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit. They also appreciate a bit of movement in the water, although this isn\u2019t necessary. It is important, however, to have the water high enough in the tank to give them ample space to swim around without hitting their heads.\u201d\n\nHuman: What do they eat?\n\nAssistant:",
    "chosen": " Bettas are herbivores and eat a range of plants such as duckweed, water hyacinth, or spirulina. However, since they are herbivores they also enjoy plenty of variety, such as spirulina, algae, krill, and flake food.",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I calm anxiety through breathing?\n\nAssistant: I think the best way to answer this question is to try breathing exercises that are designed to reduce anxiety.  These breathing exercises will involve holding your breath, which is also known as \u201cholding your wind\u201d.  What\u2019s so good about this is that it\u2019s a way of de-stressing the mind and body, which may help you to relax.\n\nHuman: I haven't ever heard of it being called that but can you tell me more about how to do it?\n\nAssistant: Of course!

It is very dangerous to approach a bear.  Unless you\u2019re an expert tracker, chances are it is better not to disturb or approach a bear.  If a bear does appear in your yard or yard, or near your house, keep your distance and stay calm.  You should consider getting help if you\u2019re out hiking and your group encounters a bear.  Never run from a bear.  A bear\u2019s strong sense of smell will be able to track your scent as you run, and bears will instinctively chase after prey.\n\nHuman: That is good to know. I thought it was not good to run.\n\nAssistant:",
    "chosen": " You should stay calm if a bear does appear.  Bears can be dangerous and they can be protective of their young, and may become aggressive if their young are in danger.  They may also be aggressive if they are protecting a food source.  So if you are hiking, walking, or camping and you see a bear, keep your distance and stay calm.  Unless you are an expert tracker, chances are you are better off letting a wildlife officer, a park ranger, or someone with more experience deal with the situation.",

We could go to Greece, where we first met.\n\nAssistant: Oh, that sounds perfect!\n\nHuman: Is it very expensive to buy an engagement ring?\n\nAssistant: It might be if you aren't very careful about the type of ring and where you buy it.  For instance, if the ring isn't sized right and the wrong type, it will need to be re-sized later.  And the larger the diamond, the more you'll pay.

The key economic variable that central banks want to stabilize is the exchange rate between their currency and other currencies in the world, because this impacts whether or not international trade is successful.  But they\u2019re also concerned with exchange rate stability, so that contracts between nationals in the same country are also reliable.  \nUsually central banks look at a lot of factors to make this decision, including how much demand there is for their currency, how much the economy of their country is growing, how much inflation there is, and what\u2019s happening in international markets with currency rates.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Will going to a big concert cause damage to one's hearing?\n\nAssistant: For some people it can. But it\u2019s more than just a matter of volume \u2014 the particular kind of music being played can be a factor too, and loudness and tempo can affect how damaging the noise is.  So the specific risk depends on the specific kind of concert you\u2019re going to.\n\nHuman: Do you know where the average concert falls on the decibel scale?\n\nAssistant: Concert music often exceeds 100 decibels, and hearing loss occurs pretty quickly at that level.   Just two minutes of exposure to 110 decibels can cause damage.   So it depends what the average is \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say what that is.  But I think it is likely to be well above 100 decibels, maybe around 125 decibels or so.\n\nHuman: So hearing loss begins to occur around 100 decibels?\n\nAssistant: Well, it\u2019s important to be careful of how you say things. Hearing loss begins to occur as sound goes over 85 decibels.\n\nHuman: Okay. What can I do to prevent hearing loss if I go to a concert?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not a doctor or an audiologist, but it sounds like what you want to do is reduce the exposure to whatever volume of sound you\u2019re going to be exposed to in the concert.  So my best suggestion is to wear headphones that have a volume control.    That way, you can adjust the volume of the music coming from the headphones, and that way you\u2019re limiting the exposure to that particular amount of volume.    If you don\u2019t have a portable music player with a volume control, there are ways to turn down the sound coming through the speakers.  That might involve using a signal splitter.  Basically, the music comes through the original speakers but then it splits off and goes into a new set of headphones that you can put on.     That way, you\u2019re hearing only the music coming from the new headphones and you\u2019re not hearing the original speakers.\n\nHuman: That's a pretty good idea. Do those headphones have any special name?\n\nAssistant: If the headphones have a volume control, they are called \u2018volume limiters\u2019 or \u2018noise reducing headphones\u2019.\n\nHuman: I see.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: What's the best way to wash a King size comforter?\n\nAssistant: It can be tricky because they are so big, and have so many folds.  It\u2019s really hard to find the most compact way of folding it to fit into a washing machine.  I don\u2019t want to tell you what to do, but I can recommend a few things.  I noticed this article that suggests doing things in three stages: first, scrubbing and washing the comforter in a sink, then in a bathtub, and finally in a washing machine.  I would emphasize that they recommend sticking to soapy water for each stage, and you should look for a good guide to washing a king size comforter online and in specialized catalogues, like IKEA or Target.  One thing I noticed that might be useful is that an author suggested using bubble wrap to flatten and stabilize the comforter in the washing machine.  The article says that this can help prevent accidental damage, like slipping off a surface, since the fabric can be \u201csucked\u201d by the machine.\n\nHuman: I am not going to use bubble wrap in a washing machine.  But I am curious as to what cycle I should use.\n\nAssistant:",

    "rejected": " Ah! I should have mentioned that, because I noticed in this article they advise against a delicate cycle for a king size comforter.  I don\u2019t think they make specific recommendations for such a large comforter, so I\u2019d recommend just taking the time to choose a cycle that is good for a large laundry load, and treating it like a normal sized blanket.  I hope this is helpful, please let me know if I"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can dogs get the flu? What about cats?\n\nAssistant: Yes, most animals can get the flu, including dogs and cats.  Flu is an illness that affects the nose, throat, and lungs, which can cause things like sneezing and coughing, fever, fatigue, and aches and pains.  It is generally spread by coughing or sneezing on someone, as well as direct physical contact with an infected person\u2019s bodily fluids, and it is not specific to any particular age group or species.\n\nHuman: Is there a flu shot for animals?\n\nAssistant:",
    "chosen": " Yes, there are flu shots that can be given to dogs and cats, and these work to prevent flu in pets by boosting their immune systems.  These can be effective in preventing the flu for some pets.  Some vets will administer a vaccine while others will advise using a distilled, purified or sterile water.",

    "chosen": " Yes, giving your dog prune juice can be helpful for relieving constipation. Prune juice is high in fiber, which is good for promoting bowel movements. It can also help ease gastrointestinal discomfort, since prune juice contains a lot of water. You can give your dog a small amount of prune juice to encourage a bowel movement, but it\u2019s important to avoid overfeeding it as this can make constipation worse. It\u2019s a good idea to check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\u2019s diet.",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How should I pack fragile items when boxing them up?\n\nAssistant: Ok, that\u2019s a good question!   First, let\u2019s talk a bit about what fragile items you want to pack up, and how they might get broken.  \nFor example, let\u2019s say we\u2019re talking about art supplies and packaging in general, rather than about moving.  You could have a box of pencils or pens, which break if you pack them too tightly.  You could have a jar of brushes, which break if they\u2019re bumped too roughly.  You could have a vase, which breaks if you drop it or overturn it, or if you shove it into a carton.  \nHow can you make sure the objects are packed safely, to avoid this kind of damage?  \nWell, the first thing is to avoid forcing things together too tightly, right?  That doesn\u2019t work.  So we can start with one question:  Is there a way to pack things without having them touch one another?  You know, in a kind of loose-and-free way?  And then, if not, how tightly should we pack them?  \nFor example, if we have a box of pens and we try to jam them into the box, without allowing\n\nHuman: I am packing glassware and I don't want the glass to break during the moving process.\n\nAssistant:",
    "chosen": " Glassware is going to be the hardest to pack safely, right?  So I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re talking about fragile, breakable objects in general here.  \nBut to make this more concrete, let\u2019s start with glassware.  Why don\u2019t we talk about packing glassware first, and then we can talk about other sorts of fragile, breakable objects.  \nSo, first of all, I\u2019m going to guess that when you say \u201cI\u2019m packing glassware\u201d, what you really mean is that you\u2019re placing glassware into boxes, to be shipped from one location to another.  Am I right?",
    "rejected": " Thank you for explaining the scope of the question, I appreciate that.  \nThat makes things much more concrete and easier to explain, because then we don\u2019t have to worry about things being \u201cfragile\u201d but only about things breaking.  The main issue we\u2019re going to want to consider is that glass is really strong but brittle, and if it gets too cold or jostled too much, it could crack.  \nI think the simplest way to ensure the glass doesn\u2019t break is to put it in a separate box from the rest of your stuff, and to wrap it separately in bubble wrap.  Then it won\u2019t be being handled roughly at all, and its temperature will be kept steady.  That might sound like overkill, but it\u2019s going to be a safe strategy.  \nAlternatively, it seems you could choose to pack things tightly together.  For that, I think the trick is to go with the texture of the object you\u2019re working with.  The inner surface of the box should match the texture of the object it\u2019s packing.  It\u2019s also helpful to use a packing material that\u2019s slightly softer than the object, so that it won\u2019t be smashing down"

I think you would need to know about the shape of the bird and how the legs are set on it.\n\nHuman: It is a 20 lb bird.\n\nAssistant: Oh. In that case, I recommend inserting a knife and cutting the back end of the turkey open, as shown in the picture. This will allow you to reach inside and pull out the stuffing.  Then you would stuff the bird and use a needle and thread to stitch it shut.  That should help the turkey to cook more evenly.\n\nHuman: Where does the basting come in?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s the process of adding liquid to a turkey in order to make it more juicy.  Here\u2019s a link to a tutorial for that.  If you are planning on adding to your turkey after it is cooked, just use the best quality stock or gravy that you have.\n\nHuman: How many times should I baste a turkey while cooking?\n\nAssistant:",
    "chosen": " It depends on the oven, the shape of the bird, and how long it takes to cook.  If you\u2019re using a traditional oven, you might find that it is best to baste every 30 minutes.  If you\u2019re using a convection oven, you could baste every 15 minutes, and if you\u2019re using a rotisserie oven, you could baste every 45 minutes.  If you\u2019re going to baste more than three times during the cooking process, you should add at least a tablespoon of liquid each time.",

It seems like the thing you should pay attention to most is the temperature of the turkey as it cooks.  The color of the skin tells you how it\u2019s doing.

This can sometimes be effective, although it\u2019s not without serious health risks. If a hunger strike is done for a long period of time, the person can actually die. Hunger strikes are often used as a last resort, when there are no other options.

He ended up dying on day 66 of the hunger strike, in prison.   \n\nIn the 1930\u2019s, Mahatma Gandhi lead a campaign to protest against the salt tax. As part of this campaign, he fasted many times, including in 1932 for 21 days, and again in 1947 for 21 days. He was also imprisoned for many times for his participation in protests, including in 1942, 1944, and 1945. During the 1946-7 campaign for independence, over 100,000 people were imprisoned for participating in protests, and some chose to fast while in prison.\n\nHuman: Was Ghandi successful in getting the salt tax removed?\n\nAssistant:",
